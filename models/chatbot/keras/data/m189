Let me see.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Be nice.
And Flash isn't?
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Sexual tension...
I'm always here, Pete.
I know.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
No, no.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Oh, sure.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
Remember Little League?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Nonot really.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
You stop him?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
No. No, that's okay.
What, want a glass?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Here you go, Pete.
Or was it all a dream?
See?
I was there.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Flash, drop it--
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Flash, get lost.
Hm.  What a lump.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
I'm parked illegally!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Lizzy!
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
I got you a present.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
You get mugged or something?
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Mm-hmm.
Jesus Christ.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
Don't be pitiful.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
I know.  I've got one too.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Harry
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Harry!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
What's in there?
They'll never take me alive.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Right.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
How are you doing, kid?
Get away from me, freak!
Are you okay?
That's not even close.
Lemme down, bugface!
Now tell me you love me.
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Mr. Jameson--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Can't focus...
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
Can we make it a hundred?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Yeah--
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Hmf-hrr?
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Fine.
Frmpph-yrr.
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Would you cool it already?
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
You're making my life difficult.
How about tomorrow?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
A spider.  Eight legs.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Are you quite finished?
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Well...
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Thanks, I already ate.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Just call me Spidey.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
What if the world ends tomorrow?
What if you get hurt?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Even if they're not clever.
Some things you should say anyway.
He knew.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Nah.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Why?
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Hello, Liz.
I'm here...
Peter?
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Strong...
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I know what you mean.  I...
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
You'd feel what?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Well, no.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
I think I'd like that.
Do you mind if I come too?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
I've got no problems.
What's your problem?
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
I'm sure you kept warm.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Hi, Adele.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
I've gotta study.
What are you doing this weekend?
Hurry up, Flash!
I'd never admit that.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Does it have a human name?
Some prep school thing.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
You should write that one down.
But you like that in a man?
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
What?
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I suppose.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
My my.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Thank God.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
I hate--
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Uh is a good start.
I-- uh--
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Huh?
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
It's too early to be clever.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Good morning, Liz.
Precise equipment such as waldos
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Any sign of our friend?
Yeah, Roz.
Peter-- my condolences.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Of course.
I know him.
You sure about all this?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Toxic dumps, huh.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Waldos.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
So you've found Thorkel?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
How is he?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Aunt May, what happened?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Peter, you're bleeding.
See?  You big dullard.
A match made in heaven.
Use a fork.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Absolutely no class.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
What the hell is that?
It'll shut itself off.
The record--
No.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It's Friday night...
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
I'm a photographer, remember?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'll introduce you.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I am old enough to--
Oh, Peter. A zit.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
That's the understatement of the year.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Poison emergency.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I will finish what I've begun
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
No!
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
I don't care.  Cretin.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Let's talk in the hall.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
No. It isn't.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Creation? Or its opposite?
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
I left a paper in my desk.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
I'll try. Thanks.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Need any more help?
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
How much do you know about it?
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Really, Professor, I--
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Your dog ate it.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Peter, what can I do for you?
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Mr. Parker.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
No
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
What?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
So they're airing this tonight?
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Like it?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
No, no!  Not there!
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
I'm not so happy myself.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Phooey on that.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Do you... live around here?
Just drop me off here.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Bonkers.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Imagine how I feel.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
You're sure you're all right.
Right.  Let's go.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
