I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Shhh... don't talk.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Emma...
Yes.
Do you still want me to stay?
Yes.
You want me to stay?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
That's who you are too, Emma.
I don't know.
Who?
Humans.
What's inside?
Yes.
Have you looked inside?
I don't know.
Have you always had it?
Mine.
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
We don't know that --
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
You know what I mean.
What do you mean?
What do you want?
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
I only protect myself -- !
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What choice did I have -- ?!
You're not them.
Why don't you start with me?
You want to kill them.
Yes.
You want to find them.
Where you lived with them.
What?
Do you remember where it is?
Yes.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
My wife.
Who is this?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
With them?
What about... now?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Do you remember where you lived?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
How much do you remember?
Do you want to go on?
Yes.
Are you all right?
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
My name is Robert.
That is not now, human!
You lived like this once.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
No.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Stay alive.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
What?
Virginia...?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
I surrender --
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
You and that damned garden.
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
Yes.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Round back.
Bathroom?
I guess you could say that.
You built things.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
So, what do you do?
You got that right.
Hell of a night.
That's fine.
Only got one kind.
Please.
Need some gas?
