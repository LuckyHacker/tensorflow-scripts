FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
NOT THAT ONE?!
Not that one.
The walls are steel, right?
You know how this gotta end.
Bullshit.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
Get the fuck away from me.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
-- posed to mean?
You finish.  Then we finish.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
That's their problem.
That's your problem.
She better.
She's gonna handle it.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
Are you gonna open the safe?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
The hell does she want?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Are you okay?
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
You got an idea?
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Th --
I can't just...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
This is ridiculous...
One.  Squeeze.
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
I can't...
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
I can't.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
What?  What do you want me to do?
Please...
Remember that.
Yes.
I have the gun.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
That's right.
Me.  I am.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Stop it!  Stop it!
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
The fuck did you do that for?!
You should see the look on your face.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
He said open it.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
There is not one thing funny here.
God.
What the fuck is funny about this?
She didn't.
What if she called the cops?
Peace out.
You're welcome.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
No problem.
Not with me.  Not with people.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
What?
Adios.
I mean it!
Yeah, whatever.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
What about us?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Do me a favor and don't talk.
And we're never getting in.
Hey.
She's never coming out.
Shit!
Cell phone.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
They're gonna die in there!
They're coughing.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Be quiet.
I did.
Open it.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
She said she did.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Shut up and let me think.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Shut up.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
Pure idiot.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
Different tables.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Where did you get this clown?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Asshole.
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
They won't get hurt.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Unless Daddy comes back later.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Who is this guy?
You're an idiot.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Keep your voice down.
Fuck!
I know.
Fuck.
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
Huh?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Oh, that phone call...
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
You don't look so good.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Can we come in?
No, you can't come in.
We'd like to come in.
What do you want?
Can we come in?
Somebody called you?
I don't get it.
'Bout four o'clock.
Huh?
Everything okay?
Yeah?
Not at all.
That door is a safely hazard.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Oh, I've seen these...
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Could the child please stop that?
Master closet.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Master bath.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
No ball, kid.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Don't!
Push that button for me, will you?
I said open the door.
That's highly inappropriate.
Open it.
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
A what?
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Observe.
Nobody leaves.
Suit yourself.
The hell we are.
We're leaving.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
No fucking way.
Cut it back a little bit.
It's just the woman and the kid?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
It's okay, Raoul.
Watch your mouth.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Open the door.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
The furniture guy?
No, Edgar Allen.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Ever read any Poe?
Why?
Makes me nervous.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
What?
Something's weird.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
How many more do we have after this?
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
Okay.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Where is the Glucogen?
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
What if I spazz out?
What if I do?
Not an option.
What if I keep dropping?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Huh uh.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
What?
I was trying not to tell you...
Why?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
He WILL.
He --
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Stop it.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He won't even know who it was.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Uh uh.
He'll do something.
On it!
Call Dad!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Blue is phones?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
I saw something, I saw...
What are you doing?
Close it!
No.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Do it.
Shhh...
We're never getting out of here.
Come on, come on...
Got him!
"Titanic."
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Morse code?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
What, what, what is it?!
I'm here.  I'm here.
YOU HAVE TO!
I am.  I'm here.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
To prove he wasn't chicken.
I don't know, why?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Don't though. 
Small space?
Little bit.  Yeah.
Are you freaking out?
Give me a break.
Oh, please.
Get the fuck out of my house!
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Fuck.
Say fuck.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"What we want is in that room."
Huh uh.
Chills?
Nope.
Shaky?
Yeah.
Feel okay?
I heard you.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
What if they get in here?
Wait.
What do we do?
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
What do they want?
Can't hear a thing.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
It doesn't work?!
Damn it!
PANIC ROOM!
What?!
That room!
He's going down.
People.  In the house.
What's going on?!
Fuck her too.
Don't.
Fuck him.
0150.
478...
The crowd goes wild.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
478-0150.
Well, I know that now.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Too many stairs.
