So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
I love Christmas in Turkey.
We cant.
Weve got to get out.
Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
But what if...
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Like riding a bike.
Do you know what youre doing?
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Hes sealed himself in.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Is there another way?
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
Zukovsky...
Elektra would control it all.
The King pipeline.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Made to look just like an accident.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Nuclear.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
What is it?
I was hoping you could tell me.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Makes her look even more innocent.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Elektra King.
Whos she?
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
What the hell are you talking about?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
Then its no longer a bomb?
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
Alright then, brunch.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
With this?
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
Bond --
So who are you?
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Dont know any doctor jokes.
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
You new?
I could come for a second opinion?
...yes?...
Perhaps after this ... test?
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
James.  It wouldnt really be...
Its just a scratch.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
The inside man?
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
The worm on the hook again.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
He survived?
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Renard.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Who?
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
I was the one who brought that money in...
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
I took the initiative.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Shes not a girl anymore.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Old friend?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Constructions not exactly my line.
I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
The name?
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Your last chance. Take the money.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Who did you get it from?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
Shell get over it.
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Consider me ungrateful.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Who is it?
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Indeed.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Im sorry.
He was my father.
You knew him well?
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Yes.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Oh James.
One... last... screw?
Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
Was this all about the oil?
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
So you killed your father.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
You turned Renard.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Soon shell be everywhere.
Wheres M?
Not interested.
I could have given you the world.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
Im coming with you.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
He used your exact words.
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
I think you do.
I dont know what youre talking about!
You can drop the act, its over.
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
...what?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
What are you talking about?
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
How did you survive?
Shush.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Really?
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
What the hell are you doing here?
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Vodka martini.
I have to go to work.
I dont want to be safe!
No. Youll be safe here.
Then take me with you.
I have to go.
James...
...you should rest.
What is it?
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
I know.
I cant stay.
Its the only way out...
No!  It will cave in!
Youre not going to.
I cant stay here.
Were alright.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
No.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Does this look familiar to you?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
How long has he been with you?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Who is he?
Partially, yes.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Funerals arent exactly memorable.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Yes.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
How appropriate.
The Maidens Tower.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Mother of God.
Istanbul.
Where?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
No!  Get me out!
Wheres the sub going?!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
And the payoff on the tables?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
A rope!
Now...where were we?
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
I thought you were the one in her business.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
Where did you get this?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
What?  This is not possible.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
You, of course. I need some information.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Valentin Zukovsky.
C-class.
What class sub does your nephew run?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
What is this place?
Bond!
No! Bond!
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
What?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Someone will come.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Your father...
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Please.
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Could...could you come?
Ill send someone out.
Yes.  Au revoir...
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
This is the end.
What do you think?
He was a...good lover?
Of course...
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
How would you know?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Is it?
Warm.
Still no contact yet.
Any word from him?
Where it can do the most damage.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
The parcels in the post.
Marvellous.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
