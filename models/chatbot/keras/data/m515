Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
The moon's not down yet...
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Can I tell you kids something?
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Jesus.
Blue. This blue.
Lowe's car-?
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Uncle Al-
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
You're a real booger, you know it?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Are you all right, Marty?
Jane-
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Will you?
Please, Uncle Al.
Will you marry me, Jane?
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Went shopping. Why?
Where's Mom?
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Let me help you up.
Yes. Go away.
Stop it!
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
What's the money for?
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Rats...
Rattling. Rustling.
What kind of noises?
I've been hearing noises in there.
What?
There's something else scary.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Well... it is his third.
For getting a divorce?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
What's that?
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
You booger.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
What if I say no?
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
But Uncle Al! You said-
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
Yeah? Really?
Will you do it?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
I saw what I saw.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
No.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
It could have been anything, Marty.
There! You see!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
I told you!
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
I told you!
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
You want to know what I think?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
Well... was it a prescription?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
What the hell does that matter?
Was it a prescription?
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
A tracer. You'll like it.
What is it?
Save this one for last.
Yeah... sure.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Yeah! What is it?
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Good.
Sure.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
I don't get you.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
Do I need one?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
What?
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Your mom's not around, is she?
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Don't call me dear boy.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
What if it's some kind of monster?
Huh?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
No.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Yeah.
You all right, Marty?
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Mom-!
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
I will- be good, kids.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
We won't!
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
