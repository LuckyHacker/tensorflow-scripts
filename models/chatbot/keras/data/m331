He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
But you haven't written your novel.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
In love?
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Here, get down.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Thank you.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
What kind of person?
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
what?
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
What?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
You guys have fun?
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
How'd it go?
Do it!
Yeah, just --
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Yeah, uh, just a minute
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
He likes it.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
Anything wrong?
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
So nice
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Dick.
Having a problem with your eye there?
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
What?
Dick... Dick,..
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
But, Mr. M. -
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Mostly Tammy fans
I think we've got a problem.
Yeah?
Larry?
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
Mr. M.?
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
You're kidding, right?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
What d'you got?
All right.  I'll be back
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
You will.
I hope so
You'll be fine.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Take as much room as you want
What a surprise.
Would you sign it for me?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I want you to do something for me.
My house.
What's this?
I've got an idea.
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Doing what?
Why are you doing this?
Yes?
So Tracy?
That sounds good.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Uh-huh.
Plenty of pep, too.
Yeah.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Where to?
Sporty.
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Good for you.  Good for you
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
I'm looking at new cars.
So what brings you here?
Hello, Tracy.
Hello, Mr. M.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
What do you mean?
Looks like today's your lucky day
Yes?
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Why are you lecturing me?
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
I guess you know why you're here
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Looks like Tim Kobza.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
As far as I know, they--
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Good luck, Tracy.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Sure
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
You bet.
Thanks for everything.
Okay, fine. Sure
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
NO, that's fine
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Looks good to me.
Right
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Here they are.
Hey, that's super
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Ethics are...
Tracy.
I know.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Thanks, Mr. M.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Yes, I do.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Oh yeah, you bet.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Oh.  Okay.
Walt needs to see you.
Hmm?
Uh, Jim?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
I have proof.
I don't believe you.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Which door?
Door was open.
And how did you get in the school?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Exactly when?
This weekend.
And when did you do it?
I did it.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
What is it. Tammy?
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
So... what do you have to tell me?
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Just wait outside. Tammy.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
I was lonely.  You took advantage
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Sherry... I love you.
Yeah.  I'm here.
You're there.
What do you want, Jim?
Three twenty-five.
Three twenty-five.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Right now?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Hey Yeah?
We'll let it run awhile
Yep.
Still clear?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Dave.
Shall we give it a name?
Oh.
points at the motel.
Should we get a what?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
You sure?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
More this way.
Here?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Sure.
Could you get this? I can't
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
I also like bananas.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
Okay, let's say
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
And she's super-nice
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
What do you mean?
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Yeah.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Larry, you just take it easy
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
If you say so.
And 290 "disregards," right?
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Well, I do.
I don't care.
But other people can see them too.
I know.
These are private -- these are for us.
So?
People can see this.
What?
Are you crazy?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
What...?
I'm not like you.
Where 're you going?
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
What?
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
For what?
I mean at you.
For what?
She's doing this to get back at me
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Sorry.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Yes, Paul?
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Can I sign yours too?
Sure, Tracy.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Yeah.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Thanks!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Hell, good luck!
Yeah.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Thought what?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
What do you mean?
Who put you up to this?
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Who put you up to this?
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Now could you leave me alone?
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What do you want?
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
What'd I do?
You dumbshit!
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
Paul, get out!
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Don't you fucking knock?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
