I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
I <u>swear</u> to you...
...<u>please</u>...
...I was <u>working</u>...
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
They're offering... 
And?
Some museum director disappeared.
A reward for what?
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
...you don't have to think.
I can't think.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
Aren't you glad to see me?
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
Who would that be.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Rich, comic book freaks.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
...they did it for a lark.
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
You want me to be?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
Then who's buying it?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Say it in English.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
That would adversely impact my income.
Now, whyn't you help us?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
...why?
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
...very good.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Why me?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Yes?
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
I'm looking for...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
...you...
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Orderly.
What have they got you doing?
It's a growth business.
...how are things at the Hospital?
Or, perhaps...
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It wasn't my day.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Well.  Word gets around.
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
I hereby acknowledge that...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I have not read you your rights.
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
What, What, I can't hear you...
...these guy'll back you up.
I know her by the Back.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
What's new onna street?
Then I'm doing fine.
That's right.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
How you doin?
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
How crazy is that.
...the whole world's out to get you...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
And who is "they?"
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
Then you tell me, then.
That's what <u>you</u> think...
I'm not.
You're ready now.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You want to get married...?
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
C'mon, pal.
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
Evelda Drumgo.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
Bad beat today.
...would you excuse me...?
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
...his family has offered a large reward.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
That's why my wife adores me.
You take this much time over everything?
First things first.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Hold up a minute...
...what a world.
Impossible.
...are they hard to get?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
What else did I miss...?
Their family owns...
They got that kind of money?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Yeah, so where is he?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
What's up...?
...nightmare.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
How was America?
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
..It won't be long now, sir...
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
What do you want me to do?
Have the child taken to bed.
He escaped...
Show me the Pigs.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
...sir...?
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
Somewhere in Italy.
Where was the call from.
...Let's see the pigs, please.
<u>Do</u> it...
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
Seen what, sir..?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...are you alright, sir...?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Why did he come back?
Not with any certainty we...
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Awright.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
You give me whatever I want...?
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I like Popcorn...
No.  And...
He don't like popcorn.
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
No, no, of course not.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
And how would you know that?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
He is...?
Try Barney Clark.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Exactly.
What reaction?
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
What would <u>that</u> be?
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
I won't take much of his time.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
I've never heard that he...
...they're from Baltimore....
The children...?
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
'fraid it's too late.
For a consideration.
Why?
Let the girl go.
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
....what...? 
...unmarked hundreds....
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
..suitcase...locker...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
I can make you rich.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Yes, I did.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Mmm...
...here's to child abuse!
...young boys, still...?
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
I know you did what you could.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I am all attention.
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
Yes sir, I saw it. 
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
No. 
Am I on that case, sir...? 
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
...standard issue...
A fellow with five fingers.
...what'm I looking at...?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
You seen John Brigham...?
Look at this:
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
...what's he got against you?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
Starling...?
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Shut up, Starling...
Sir:
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
That could be.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I think its meaning is clear.
What is that supposed to mean...?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Give it up.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Give it up, Evelda.
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Waal...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
I said how's your baby...?
How's your <u>child</u>?
Waited too long, hon...?  
Well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
I said sometime it gets so...
What'd you say, hon...?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Waal...
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
I'm an orphan.
Said what?
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
You nervous...?
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
That, that was <u>business</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
...how so?
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
Well, perhaps sometime we...
...should love to correct your error. 
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
I have had many excellent meals there.
You know it?
A wonderful country...
My husband brought it to me from America.
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...yes, yes, yes...
I require...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
...long overdue.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
Who does not?
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Darling...
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Enchante.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
You know America?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
How could you know?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
And?  Then?
I have had the honor. 
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Yes.  How did you know?
Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
How so?
My scar is a war-wound.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
Why did you look at me that way?
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
If your duty requires it.
I'll have them picked up.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
...yes.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Of course, Commendatore...
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
...who say...?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Yes.... yes...
We got KittyKat...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
No. 
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
She my foster.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Where do you live?
...Franklin.
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
Is it necessary to know?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
...tell them...
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Make them eat the figurine.
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
...may be the heat....
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
I realize, you're under a lot of....
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I came to pay my...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
No, I don't get you...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
You were given backup....
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
Sir, with all due respect....
And you let her get away.
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
And how did he do that?
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
...and my need for The Institution...
Indeed we were.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...I'm sorry....?
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
You look lovely.
Spoken like a Protestant.
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
...what has she done to harm you...?
...when I... 
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
...might I make a suggestion...?
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
The girl needs help.
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
...which of us is free...?
You're <u>free</u>...
The girl could use some help.
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
<u>Yes</u>.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Why should <u>you</u> care?
...but will that satisfy you?
Thank you, Cordell.
...<u>what</u>...?
Give me your gun...
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Why?
Don't shoot yourself.
You goin to shoot yourself? 
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Every suicide kills two.
No.
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
...what...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
...what?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
What was it.  What was it, honey?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
...not to turn around.
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>! 
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
You should get Married.
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
Look what they put her on...
Oh baby, oh baby....
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
What's that, Baby?
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
You want another drink, honey...?
...get me a cigarette.
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Ask me when we get home.
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
....because we don't have any mmm...
"Because we don't have any money."
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
Because...?
Then we cannot go.
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
...what do you expect me to...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
I am on the track of...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
...my love...
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I don't understand.
...and that is what you need to expand.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Fine, thank you, but
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
The shape of a Three.
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
And why should we believe you?
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know where he is.
...what did you want? 
Hello....?
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...but:  this particular statue...
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
I know it well.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
...what a lovely perfume.
Or clear your windshield with it.
Thank you.
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Hey, lost again.
...<u>sadly</u>...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
It would seem.
Brazilian. 
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
Dottore Fanelli...
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
What're they on about?
...yes, yes, yes....
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
She must be something special After Dark.
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
...I feel that...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
When?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
...yes...?
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
...why?
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Yes.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
...yes...?
I..
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
What is your point?
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
Yes.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
That's right.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
I don't understand.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
Yes.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
For approval.
...would you use a small word?
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
Yes.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
...no.
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
...no...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no...
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
Then what brings you back?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
....that's right.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
Then tell me.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Tell me why...?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
...sir...?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
My encounter.
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Because?
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
