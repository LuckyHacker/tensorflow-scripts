We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
<U>Answer</U>!
Our data is being prepared.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
The information will not be disclosed.
They have repressed the Creator.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Disclose the information.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
The Creator has not answered.
<U>Why</U>?!
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<U>Why</U>...?!
You may proceede.
The examination is a normal function.
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
Who is V'ger?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
To join with him.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
By the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
That is how V'ger will survive.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
That is logical. You may procede.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
What does that mean?
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Yes.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Engineering...
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Departure angle.
Departure angle on viewer.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
No!
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Captain, what's the next move?
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
It's taken control of the computer...!
<U>Computer off</U>!
You asked my opinion, sir.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Mr Decker....
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Granted.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Stop competing with me, Decker!
I'm aware of that, sir.
You saved the ship.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Programming ready?
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
May I ask Why?
Yes.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You are what...?
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
A tractor beam...
Forward motion, Captain...!
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
This served the purpose.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
No.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Was he difficult?
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Decker....!
Hello, Ilia.
Viewer, standard ahead.
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Ten seconds....
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Mr. Spock?
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Twelve seconds...!
Time to impact...?
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
'Commander' Decker?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Thrusters at station keeping...
Hold station...!
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Viewer ahead, sir.
Viewer ahead.
Hold relative position here...
One hundred kilometers...
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Hold station.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
We're losing the pattern...!
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
The point... 
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
There is no alternative.
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Not for us?
Precisely.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
Child...!?
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
What answers?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What should you have known?
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
They had a pattern to follow...
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Mr. Decker... ?
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Our... 'insignificance'?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
Any reply from them?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
And whatever you sensed out here....
I still contain fragments of my human half.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I want him here.  Sit down!
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
Sit down, please.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
To you, sir?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Why aren't you on board?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
We're ready, sir.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Tractor beam remains constant...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Helm ready, sir.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
