Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
So she did witness it?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Could I have that in American?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
How is she?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
Sheriff, I don't...
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
...I meant your food.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
I know plenty.
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Little place called "Williams," why?
Any idea where it is?
What about it?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
That's a nice name for what you need...
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
No, I didn't have to.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
I know that...
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Tell him what you told me.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
We think we know where Betty is.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
You're lying!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Oww, the arm, the arm!
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
A woman can write a check.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Anyway, so what?
Junior year!
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Yeah?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Bad idea...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Did you send anyone out there?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
You think a woman did that?!
Jesus...
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
It wasn't a woman.
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
No, Elden, I need to...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Oww! My arm, careful!
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
...plenty
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
You should get the order you want.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
You must be joking.
They're fine... you miss it?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Oh. How come?
Great. Good. Content...
No, I was just... How you doing?
Need something else?
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
"Banners?"
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
I don't think I am.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
...what're you saying?
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
I'd rather not...
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
This is really awkward...
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I better go check on them.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
I'm sorry.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
"Thirty-two?"
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Umm, I don't think that...
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
I am?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
...to see you.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
Do you know why I'm here?
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know who I am?
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Oh, this is wonderful...
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Who are these idiots?
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Umm... yes. Back home.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
Yes, ma'am.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I gotta go.
Do what?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
What are you talking about?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Well, you are.
All the time...
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Are you and Larry happy?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
I gotta go make dinner.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
The LeSabre!
What?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
It's all right.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
No... what about your sister?
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Oh, Betty --
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Did you watch it yet?
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Thanks...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
George...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
David, please --
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Why are you doing this to me?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Ad lib?
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
Yes... maybe it was.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
Didn't I?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I don't think your friend likes me.
I know. It's up to us.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Of course.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
What happened when you were twelve?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
You told me that two hours ago.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Yes, she is.
Lyla's very nice.
You're late, Eric.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Why do they keep calling you George?
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
You never gave us a chance...
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
You knew Del?!
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
No, Del.
Oh, you mean Fred.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
That's very kind of you.
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
I beg your pardon?
We were engaged.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
I don't know.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
I came for love...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
That is a skill!
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
They're new to us...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
...well, then you ain't got much.
I got you, Del...
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
What?
...like the water purifiers?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Sure you don't want any salad?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
What was that?
What's so special about it?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I ran back in to get the phone.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
So, call me when you --
It's not really a good time, guys...
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
You're in serious danger!
Roy! What are you doing here?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
It was Chloe...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Yes.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
What're you doing here, Roy?
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Uh-huh.
Make sure it's elevated...
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
You made out alright.
Worse.
Like Rome?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Dr. David Ravell.
What's his real name?
How did you know?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
No. Loma Vista.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Really?
I left my husband two days ago.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
That's horrible!
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Did you love it?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Los Angeles, California.
Where you headed, Betty?
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
I'd slap his face.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
I begged him to let me put that on!
What's the matter here?
...did I win some contest?
She called you 'George,' George.
I married a car salesman.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
Your husband?!
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
I have to leave now.
Where are you going?
...this is your sweater, right?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
What are you doing?
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Rosa, so you've met David?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
You should have a little faith in people.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Rosa...
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
No, almost never.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
He is real.
Does he know you think he's real?
You still in love?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Were you with him this whole time?
You never know who you'll see.
Looking for someone?
Umm...
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
What are those for?
...okay.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Fine.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
HE IS REAL!!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
What? Where was he?!
Doctor David Ravell.
Who?
Guess who I saw today.
I was talking about what you could wear!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
How many men have I talked to?
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
God, that's awful!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
He has a wife?!
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
The Five?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
The one you were telling me about?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
Man, that is love.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
It's something I had to do. For David.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
You don't sound like you're from here.
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You're hurting him!!
He has no heartbeat!
What are you doing?
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
Good.
No, that should be more than --
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Really. And where was that, old man?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
The fuck you talking about?
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Huh?
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
...and put them in your mouth.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
My socks?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
I... I don't know...
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Like what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
No...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I don't follow...
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Of what?
Could you give us an example?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
What do you mean?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Fine. You got five...
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
If we're for real?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Ahh... my wife's.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
What's wrong with you?
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
You made your point...  I was wrong.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
I said 'got it?'
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
It just didn't fit her profile...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
A doctor on the show... why?
Who's this?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Wesley...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
I never said that I believed...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
What doesn't?
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
What?
I'm not telling.
Where? Where is she?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
I said, 'No.' N-O.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
No.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
We should go.
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
How'd they describe her?
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
Worse... you're in Texas.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
I know that.
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
What?
Half.
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Like... us?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
...among others.
Joyce was screwing Del.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
I hope you're right...
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Should I kill him now?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
We can live with that.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
...that's a good motto.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I wanted to make a statement.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
It's not here. Let's go.
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
What 'look'?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
He told us it's in the Buick.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
You told me how to do it!
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
IT SURE IS!!
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
A mark, huh?
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Hell of a way to die.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Now, that's really stupid.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
That is so right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That's right.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Relax, we brought the cash.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Beer, please.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
What do you mean?
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Betty was a lovely child.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
This is Betty at twelve.
...who doesn't?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
I see.  May I?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Oh, five years, give or take.
...and how long did she work here?
"Injuns?"
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
He's waiting...
Jesus Christ!
You better believe it.
Really?
It is, if you like idiots...
Seems like a nice place.
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Isn't that the point?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
What'd you get her?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
I SAID FORGET IT!
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
No! Let me try this!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
Is there a problem, George?
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
What the hell's going on?
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
...yeah.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Hmm?
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
I said I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I'll think about it.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I don't know, George...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Can I have an evil twin?
We know that...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Sure.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
Oh fuck...
Better.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Uh-huh.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
Would you say she was ambitious?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
What did you say?
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
No... before that.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
David Ravell.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
I swear to God!
You lie, motherfucker...
She's a lesbian.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Did Chloe crack?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Huh?
Mr. Campbell?
Yeah?
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
"A Reason to Love."
Her show?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
