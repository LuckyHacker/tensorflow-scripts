Your what?
Get your hands off my daughter!
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
You.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
What do you think?
You got my barley pop?
You paying for the gas?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
How much style?
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
You know how rumors start.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
If...?
What's he get if he wins here?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
See ya, Kate.
See ya, Bandit.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
What are you thinking?
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
Absolutely.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
That man is your father?!?
He's just exhausted.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
What can I say?
Hey...
Well, thanks for the lift.
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
One to five?
Weight Station.
Why are you stopping?
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
What kind of a guy is he?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
Bandit II?
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
My very words.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
And?
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Ummm?
Kate...
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Yeah?
I'm proud of you.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
How do you know?
An unmarked police car.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Let's hit it.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Mississippi's the other way!
Like what?
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
You could've asked.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would've come back for you.
By stealing my car?
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You know this guy, don't you?
He's after us again!
What the hell are you doing?!?
Ciao.
See ya, Kate.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Jesus!!!
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Hey...
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Eleven.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
We lost him.
Well?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Shoot.
Can I ask you something?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Anything?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
What the hell's going on?
You just passed your nemesis.
I give up.
Guess what?
Would I lie to you?
Seriously?!?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Where you from?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
You have a great profile.
They're both a challenge.
Driving, talking to me...
Driving?
Is this fun?
Having fun.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Well?...
Okay.
So tell me about yourself.
Eyes on the road.
A what?
An existentialist.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
But you could get killed, right?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Who'd want to?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why're you driving so fast?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Kate McConnell.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
You sure do.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
I'll do it.
But you'll do it?
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I'm begging.
Yes.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Why should I?
Another time.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
That's me.
Order up!
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
No what?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
What's your pleasure?
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Yeah, but...
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
What's that, pardner?
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
I'm cucumber cool.
You're coming up to the scale house.
I'm here.
Bandit II?
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm all ears.
Let's boogie.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Talk to me.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
-- How we doing?
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
You okay?
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
We'll be waiting. Over.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
I'll believe it when I see it.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
We're outta motion lotion.
Now what?
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Never mind. It's nothing.
Bandit?
We're gone.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Then don't.
I hate to say it...
I ran into complications.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I'm at marker eight-five.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
What's your twenty?
Do I have a choice?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 
Yeah, guy?
Bandit?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
What does the old Timex say?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Not for long, you ain't.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What's your twenty?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit I, come back.
Bandit I, do you copy?
Clear and rolling.
Save it. We got a long haul.
I hate to say I told you so.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
We still on schedule?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Let's get the hell outta here.
They're jammed!
Hit the brakes!
Can a pig whistle?
You know how to drive one of these things?
Redneck heaven.
Liquid gold.
Let's keep it that way.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Shit! No one's here.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
He's history.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Loud and clear.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Why are we doing this?
Yeah?
Bandit?
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Six. Got it.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Go.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Running blocker.
What are you doin' now?
But I still don't think...
Also boring.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
How long's this gonna take?
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
See.
No.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Waynette!
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Or in the slammer.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
How'd you know?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
No.
Cledus.
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Go head on, breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Go breaker.
Breaker. Breaker.
About one to five years worth.
Have any trouble getting here?
He's thirsty.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
I think you're just yellow.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Bandit two, you read me?
How's your twenty?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
What's he...
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Who's Fred?
Shut up, Fred.
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
Where the hell are you?
This is Bandit I. Over.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Chickenshit money.
Five thou.
Yes, sir.
Now, you just find him, son.
Oh.
That's the point, Dickey.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
Then it must be a helluva idea.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
