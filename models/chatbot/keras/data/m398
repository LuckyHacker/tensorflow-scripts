Sure.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Good.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Didn't want to miss anything.
That's all, for now.
Yes, sir.
Too bad...
I have to get back.
It's only gonna make you crazy.
I had him!
Will, you can't blame yourself.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
What's the D.A. got them on?
So far.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
Nice kid.
What's that, then?
Just after Leland Street.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
What about your shoulder?
Why?
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Byrd's dead.
I know.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
Worth pursuing?
It's legitimate.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
Not really.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Duggar called him?
Five feet?  Seven feet?
I don't remember.
How much closer would you say you were?
Then change it.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Okay.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
That must have been awful for you.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
Twelve years younger.
She your only sibling?
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
Who's playing?
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
I could say the same thing about you.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
Yeah.  All over.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Good.  He's up next.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Who's that?
But there wasn't any...
Do it again.
We already did.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Don't worry about him...
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Actually...
You did your homework, Officer.
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
My partner...
We'll get the other one, though.
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Anything.  It's important.
What I saw?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
He would have liked that.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
Thanks.
Where is he?
Sorry about...
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
So?
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
That's right.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
No.
And something else that might interest you.
Good.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
What?
Forget your pager?
First I need a copy of the key.
I'll call him now.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
I told her to come.
What are you doing here?
No.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Has her books in it.
We're sure it's hers?
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
Around twelve-thirty.
What time was that?
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
No.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Are you sure about that?
That's right.
Randy Stetz?
That boyfriend.  Randy.
How do you mean?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
Did she?
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
What happened at that signing?
That's right.
Where you signed this?
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Don't do this, Hap...
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
Will?
Looks like the natives are restless.
What are we thinking?
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
No way.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
One word to I.A. and he walks.
You know I remember that.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
He's just rattling your cage.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
He's asking everybody questions.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
That's right.
To do nothing.
You know my plan of action.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
You know what about.
What do you want to talk about?
Even the best make mistakes.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
They're all over everybody.
Seven years.
Eight years.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
What if someone finds out?
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Will.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
One of your cases?
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
What is it?
Will...I...
What did he look like?
That's not what he thinks.
I'm not expecting anyone.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
Fred Duggar?
Habit.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
I'm always all business.
Your friend's all business.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Thought I smelled something.
She didn't tell me.
You don't know.
I don't know.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
Ran like hell to go to him...
How should I know?...
After that she left the party to go to him.
I told you I don't remember.
The other guy?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
What kind of stuff?
Stuff.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
You heard me that time.
Huh?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
Huh?
Did you love her?
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
What was it?
She used some stupid code name.
Who?
My arm!
Who?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
What was?
It was like some big fucking secret!
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
She wouldn't tell me!
You don't know.
I don't know.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
No...
Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
That's what I said.
You and Kay were like sisters?
Thought you wanted something fun...
Hey...
Long as it's fun.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
That's a long time.
Since grade school.
Best friend?
I was her best friend.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
You're not missing much.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Wild card.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
You're not following procedure.
No back-up.
Where's your back-up?
If you want it to be...
This an accident, Walter?
Yes.  Like that.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Then so was mine...
I told you that was an accident!
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
What the hell do you know?
But we work so well together...
There's nothing more to talk about.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Congratulations.
Told you I could write an ending.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
He.  Well, he...
What about him?
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Yes.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Yes.
You gave her gifts.
I was a mentor to her.
But you wanted to.
No.
Did you have sex with her?
I suppose.
But she was an attractive girl.
She was only seventeen.
Yes down at the station.
Down at the station?
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Thought you might find that.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Oh?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
I'm sorry?
The phone call.  The knapsack.
No game.
