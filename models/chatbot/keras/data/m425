Yeah, I'll stay.
You'll do it?
Ok.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Bob, it's me.
Hello?
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Yeah, they told me.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
I'll miss you.
Why are you crying?
Ok, bye.
Thanks.
Well... have a good flight.
Yes.
You're leaving right now?
Yes, no.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
That'd be great.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Hi, Bob.
Charlotte?
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Why can't it last?
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Well, I mean it more now.
That's what you said the other night.
I'm going to miss you.
Tomorrow.
When are you leaving?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
I'm sorry.
Around.
So, where'd you go today.
A coke.
What do you want to drink?
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
No, we'll find something around here.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
I don't want to be.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
No.
Do you know where we are?
Yeah.
Do you ever see him?
Working.
Where's your husband?
Yeah, look at that thing.
You think so?
We should get you to the doctor.
It's bad isn't it?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
What happened to your toe?
Fuck off.
Nice one.
Oh, she'll love it.
Four.
How old is she?
It's for my daughter.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
You made it.
Because that would be too easy.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
I know, but that's what you like about me.
You are.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
Where'd you grow up?
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
No one ever tells you that...
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
That's too scary.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
Oh.
We established that we have no communication.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
And marriage, does that get easier?
That's ok.
But, I'm mean.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
Yeah? But look at you.
No, yes, it does...
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
I know.
You're possessive.
Oh.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Oh, for her show?
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
No, I was looking at you.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Ok, whatever you want.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I don't remember.
No, you smiled.
Did I scowl at you?
Yeah, you don't remember?
Really?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
I don't know.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
No, its easy.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Hans was very attentive to you.
I see them every morning.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
OK, see you downstairs.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
Of course.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Charlotte, who?
It's Charlotte.
Hello?
I know. I don't either.
I don't want to go home.
Ok.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
No way.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Hi, Charlie.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
No.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I know, it's stupid.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
See you later.
Ok.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
I'm here for the week.
Not really. How long are you here for?
No, how about you?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Oh, hi.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi again, how's it going?
Thanks.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Oh, what do you do with that?
Philosophy.
What did you study?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What do you do?
Oh.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
I'm thinking about it.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Try twenty-five.
Two years.
How long have you been married?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
What about you? Why are you here?
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
What are you doing here?
Take them.
Yes?
My stockings.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
I don't think so.
Do you like massage?
Yes?
Mr. Harris?
Can I enter?
Oh?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Yes?
Mr. Harris?
Bye.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Ok.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Tomorrow.
When are you coming home?
That's ok.
I guess she's busy.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Yeah.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
What?
Do you want to- 
It's ok.
Fine. Is it going ok?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Hello?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Oh, come on.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Like Japanese food.
Fine.
Not all that pasta.
Alright?
You know, eat healthier.
What?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
That's not what I'm talking about.
It's just carpet.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Uh, no.
Is this a bad time?
Hi, Lydia.
Bob?
Hello?
Good-night.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Ok, well... I love you.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Yeah, its really different here.
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Hello, darling.
Lydia?
One moment.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Hello? Yes?
One moment, please.
Hospital?
Excuse me?
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Great.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Ok.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Hello?
It'll just be a few days.
I miss you.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Are you sure you have to go?
Are you sure you want to stay?
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Oh, the record company sent these...
It's ok if you are.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Ok, I will... later.
Its bad for you.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Will you please stop smoking?
I don't know.
Do you think it's done?
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
Yeah.
Bye.
See you later.
I gotta go to work.
Hair stuff?
I got some hair stuff.
Like popcorn?
What?
You smell weird.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I don't know what to do.
That's ok.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
No, what are you talking about.
Ok.
Sure.
You wanna come?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
Good...I'm tired.
How'd it go today?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Why do you have to defend her?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
What?
Evelyn Waugh?
Ok, bye.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Sure.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Lauren?
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
Oh no...
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Uh..thanks.
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
It's amazing  there!
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Promoting that action movie I did...
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
John! What are you doing here?
