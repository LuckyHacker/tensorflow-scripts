I don't recommend it.
Could he handle a direct contact?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
What's the bottom line?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
That's when it happened?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
I wouldn't presume to try.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
It was you who did the asking.
That was Peterson upstairs.
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
What about him?
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
How are Molly and the boy?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
What have we missed?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Christ!
In thirty-five minutes.
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
Library of Congress.
Where?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Not the Bible?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Book code?
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
When do they go to press?
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
Twenty minutes max.
How long do I have?
'You're very beautiful.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Read it.
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
I have to.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
It's happening again, Jack...
Wait for the back-up! Will?
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Stay in the trees.
I'll cover the back.
Three minutes.
How far away's the back-up?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
What?
Will...?
This is our boy...!
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
Parking permits...
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
It does, doesn't it?
See if there's another label underneath.
Have him peel the top label back.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
Don't talk to me!!
It's getting late and...
He had to.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
What's that?
That's why the boltcutter.
You wanna watch this or what?!
Will?
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
It's not over yet.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Something Lecktor said.
What?
He's a very shy boy...
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
There has to be.
There's no connection between the families.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
How do I know?!
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
'Changes?'
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
When I'm done.
When are you coming back?
That's narrow?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
What's it narrow down to?
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
You got the message Lecktor called...
No.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
I won't be here.
I'll pick you up in...
Get me a plane!
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane...
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Tell me now.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
What'd it say?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Who is it?
We will feel sick for a very long time.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Run it.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Personal ads?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
What is it?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
You.
Who did he ask for?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
The mark? Yes.
Is it weird?
To recover the mind set.
For Christ's sake, why?
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
See? You do know something about him.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
Why?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
No other possibilities?
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
What's one way?
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
I know...
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
What do you want to do?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
You said the guy down here is good.
Get him to Atlanta.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
These are all dead, Will.
As long as they're dead...
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
I am all right.
You look all right now.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
Why not?
No.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Somebody hurt him?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
How much do you know?
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Let's get to the physical.
Not yet.
For Christ's sake get him!
He went to the men's room.
Where the hell's Graham!
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
The Tooth...
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Francis...?
Me.
Who?
It's me.
Who is it?
Yes.
You'll come by?
I'll see you later. All right?
Are you okay...?
No. Reba...?
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Francis? Where are you?
Reba...
I'm fine, Francis.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
I'll get my purse.
I have work to do at the plant.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
I'm fine.
Yes, are you okay...?!
Is that you. D?
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
That was nice of you to think of that.
It's a surprise.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
Uh-huh.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
You worked out well.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
How did you come to Gateway?
In the kitchen.
Tonic will be fine.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
I'll take you.
It'll do fine.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Let me stick this in the black hole.
In eight days.
When do you need it?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
What's being photographed?
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
No!
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
No.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
Absolutely,
You will tell the truth?
You'll let me go now?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
No.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
God, no.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Yes.
Are you a man?
Not me.
'No' what?
Please, no.
Do you see?
Oh, God.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Yes.
Do you see?
Yes.
Do you see?
Yes...
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
No. I don't want to see you.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
In a little while I'll help you understand.
I don't know...
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
I'm very scared.
Do you feel privileged?
Yes.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
I don't want to know.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
What am I doing here?
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Was I in an accident?
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
No.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Yeah. It's right here.
Do you have it?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Yes?
Dr. Chilton.
Come in.
Three, four hours.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
In a holding cell.
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Can you read it to me?
Where did you get it?!
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's Will Graham...
Uh... sure...
I want to see Lecktor now.
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
No.
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
Thank you very much.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Okay.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Yeah...
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Hi, Linda. ..
Linda King's desk.
Goodbye.
I don't want to do that,
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
That's true.
He's very strong physically.
Cut the general crap.
He's misunderstood.
Most people are.
He's right-handed.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Why do you think I called?
Do you know something about that?
Atlanta and Birmingham.
I don't understand.
No. I can help you.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
No.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
What about the dog?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
I call him a monster.
To yourself...
What would you call him?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What happened to them?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
What's average?
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
He only bit women so far, right?
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
'Intimate? !"
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
You got a deal...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
Maybe we should give it some time...
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
That's not true.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Will?  You could come up here.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
What's the problem, Molly?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
What's this Mama shit?
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Come home with me.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
I want to see you, too.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Will? Are you okay?
Mama was probably asleep.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Hello.
Will...
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Is Crawford going with you?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
What will you do?
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
And... where are things?
No.
Can you quit?
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Then why?
No.
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
You haven't smoked in two years.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Do you remember what you said?
I remember.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
I love you...
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
Blue is cold.
Blue, then.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
I have to see somebody.
To do what?
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Tell me about yourself.
Me, too. And very erotic...
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
At the store. You doin' some good?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Hello, hotshot!
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Molly?
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
If I were?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
What the hell can I do?
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
We have it good, don't we?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
And you said?
He asked how you are.
What did he want?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
Tell her I called.
What's that?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Yes. Is Molly there?
You going back down to Florida after?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Go on to the house...
Lt. Fisk said...
Go on to the house.
Meet point's up ahead!
Thanks.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
That's right.
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Thanks for the lift.
I can't thank you enough, I...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
My name's Will Graham. I...
Yes. Who are you?
Are you George Sherman?
What do you want?
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
Huh?
What kind of coffee do you like?
...yes.
And Hobbs died?
...after a while.
She got all right?
No.
Did the girl die?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
You went in the apartment?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
How?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
How did it happen?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Are you gonna kill him?
We don't know that.
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
I figured I'd ask you...
Yes.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Yeah...
Will it keep them out?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Why does it feel good?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
I don't believe in God.
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
Fight what?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
What do you want?
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
No.
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
I haven't decided yet.
May I keep the file?
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I don't have one right now.
I want your opinion.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
Yes. I'd considered it.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
That's interesting.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
What were the yards like?
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Do you dream much, Will?
No.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Do you have the file with you
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
You're very tan, Will.
You're insane.
What disadvantage?
You had disadvantages.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Pray tell.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Why should I tell you?
I thought you would have some ideas.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
You read about it, I'm sure.
Yes.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes, I thought so.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
Very interesting, even to a layman.
And?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
No.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Stuart is fine.
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
I got it. Thank you.
Did you get my card?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Let's walk the route.
You got it.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
I hope you have a second chance...
Kevlar Second Chance.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
Yes.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Pretty well.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
