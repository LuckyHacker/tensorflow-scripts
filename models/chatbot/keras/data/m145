Go, fo' I change my mind.
And I can go free?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
That's it?
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Anything you need.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Don't move me.
Stretch it out.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Yup.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
No.  Thought he was with you.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Suga!
I don't know!
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Why you say that?
I know you smoke weed, right?
Good.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Y'all never use it?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
You paid cash?
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Well, let me in.
Yeah.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Thanks, Unc.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Alright, I'll remember that.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
Where you going?
Can I look for myself?
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
Yes you did.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
I'm his cousin.
Who are you?
Cheeco.
Fuck, what's his name?
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
What about the dog?
It's about to work, just come on.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Me neither.
Black magic.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
Naw, I already ate.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
What's the green stuff poking out?
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Not me.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
I'm gone.
You know what he mean, dude.
What you mean talk to her?
What happen?
Great moves, Day-Day.
I'll do it.
No I'm not.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Nobody!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I ain't trying to rob you...
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
What about me?
You're welcome, Unc.
No, man, just wait.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
What you see?
Wait for what?
Wait.
Me too.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
No.
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
You make it sound so easy.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
What's the B-G's?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Yeah, air.
I didn't see nothing.
You see that?
Sorry about today, man.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
I don't know yet.
What we gonna do?
Nothing.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Out the door and to the left.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Still gonna smell it.
It works.
That ain't gonna work.
Blow.
Ain't no windows in here.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
I don't.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
You better stop running from that girl.
You already in.
I ain't trying to get in it.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
What's the matter?
Okay, plan B.
$247.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
How can they do this?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
You know what this is?
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
You walked?
I walked.
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
What you mean, so?
So.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
Why?
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
That's the sister.
Who is that?
You don't know Baby D.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Damn, you got a stalker.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
What?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
I can't taste nothing.
Just a little.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
You straight?
I know, be still.
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
Thanks for reminding me.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Man, this a cool house.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
This you?
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Who is that?
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
What's crackin'?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
You alright?
Okay.
Next time, page me first.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Make sure.
It's locked.
I did.  Is that door locked?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
You did all this for me?
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Better sooner than later.
Most definitely.
I just wanted to give you this.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Hello, remember me?
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
I don't know.
You want us to give you a ride?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Karla.
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
What is it?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
I don't play for no team.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Can I help you?
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
I said hold on!
Delivery!
Hold on.
Delivery!
Nothing.
Smokin' what?
You too.
Yeah, pops!
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Come on.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
I saw it.
You see that?
Have you seen Day-Day?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
I'll remember.
Craig, remember what I told you.
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
You coming in?
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
It's alright.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Just hold your breath.
All damn.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
What it smell like?
I do.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
What's the matter?
Well bring yo' ass on...
Here I come!
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Peace out, Craig.
Nice to meet you?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
What kind of activity?
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
Excuse me?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
I don't have no damn cover.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
Call me.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Thanks for the help.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
He's a boy, dude.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Bite his ear!
Get 'em, Craig!
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
I don't know.
What?!  What that mean?
Ya'll live around here?
Hey.
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
And some rolling papers.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
This is a knock.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Go for it.
You wanna knock?
Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
Why did he go in the house?
He's inside the house?
Where's Craig?
Roach...Roach, come on.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Let it go!
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
I know.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
You could sell your Beamer.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Roach, what are you doing?
Sorry, dude.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I do.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Today ain't my day.
Negative...they vamped.
Are they still out there?
You don't wanna know.
What was that?
You damn right that's the big one.
That the big one, huh?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
What is it?
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
What it say?
What up, bro?
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I don't know.
Where's Craig?
Sorry, my ass.
I know.  I'm sorry.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
What?!
I got fired too.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
20 minutes?
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Tape his mouth shut.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Nothing.
What the fuck you looking at?
I don't know.
Hey, how you get out of here.
Good, let's get out.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Huh?
Ezal!  Ezal!
I don't know.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I can't feel my legs no more.
What?
Debo!  Debo!
Keep pushing.
You too big.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
William.
I don't know the number.
Just do it.
That ain't gonna work.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
What urgent message?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
Get on!
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Get on.
Yeah.
Rancho Cucamonga?
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
What you say?
I don't know, Debo.
Where did Craig move to?
Yeah, and hurry up.
'Take your car?'
Take your car.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Nothing.  What you want?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
I'll take you later.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
What's the matter?
My back.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Shut yo' ass up.
Need to lose some weight.
I got my mase.
What about that ugly dog?
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
I threw my back, again.
Elroy, what happen?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Mr. Nasty time?
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
What you doing to my nephew?
Huh?
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Elroy.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Oooh, ba-by!
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
