The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
But what will happen?
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
But where?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
What do you mean we?
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
At last. Ultimate Power.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
I don't feel like it right now.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Home?
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
Whatever you say.
I think I'd better keep it.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Am I? Still?
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Eliminate her.
Why did she have to show up now?
No, a super girl.
A Storm Dragon?
It's what we were warned about.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
Have fun.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
Sorry, mistress.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
But which one?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Softball.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
What does it mean?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
What is it?
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Maybe it was just an accident.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Is this Nigel's doing?
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Western Europe.
What do you want?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
She's right. They'll string her up.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
Turn it against her.
How do I fight it?
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
She has hostages.
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
Yes.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
What?
Before you go...
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Wait. Don't leave me.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
She'll forget about us eventually.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
But what if---it wasn't real?
I don't see why not.
You think so?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
And now?
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
Miss what?
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
It seemed that way to me.
I'm not mad at you.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Hi.
But I don't understand.
That makes it worse.
I sort of like what you said.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
But why?
Away. From you.
Like turning off a light.
Just like that?
I don't love you any more.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
She said it wouldn't last.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Terrific.
Is this how?
Well...I guess one is all right.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
You're not afraid are you?
No.
Let me kiss you.
What's that?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
What do you feel about me?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
You don't like me? You hate me?
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
We're from different worlds.
Why not ?
We can't do that.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
Tell me where I can find her.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Come on, let's ride.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Like it?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
This is my favourite place in the city.
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
We have to have a long talk about all this.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
You love me?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Who didn't?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
When can I see, you again ?
I have to.
Don't leave me.
Later.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
What's happening?
It's for your own protection.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Well thanks a pile, fella.
I did.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I'll mention it upstairs.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
A little.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Hmmm?
Hey! Ethan!
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
Why the empty cage?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Well...I guess I can't.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Supergirl?
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Guess! Go on.
Yeah.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
You vicious--
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
I could force you.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
No!
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
I don't want your help.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Nurse! Help !
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Nurse!
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Nurse! Nurse!
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Why should I believe you?
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
I know it.
And you think you're in love.
They think I have a concussion.
What an adorable hat.
Oh no, not you again.
I'll drink to that.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Well, just one.
A passionfruit smoothee.
What is it?
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I bet they do.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
Well, there's several ways to go .
Finished your estimate?
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
What about my proposal?
I've got things to do.
Hey, where you going?
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Why George, are you proposing?
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
The scoop of the year!
Yes.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Someone's chasing him.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Oh, no thanks.
Can I give you a lift?
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Can I quote you?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Theories?
Do you have any theories about last night?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
You're supposed to guess.
Why didn't you tell me?
You bet your ass.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I can't help it if men notice me.
Did anybody notice you?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
How do you know?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
Oh, sure.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
As brave as my father. As wise.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Superman will return it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Can you create life?
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
I don't understand.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Where is Earth?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
What's a tree?
It's going to be a tree, I think.
What are you making:
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
He's nice.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Lucy; come back!
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
It doesn't seem right.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
You sure?
No thanks. You go on.
It was just a trim.
Your hair looks the same.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
But what for?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Must've been a defective puck.
How'd you do that?
She's a beast.
She did that deliberately.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
You're not...an orphan are you?
I'd rather not talk about it.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
This is all your clothes?
There isn't any.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
I can do that.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
What? Me?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
I'd love to.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
No, MR. Danvers.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
I'm Linda Lee.
What can I do for you?
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
Don't you believe in knocking?
Nonsense.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
I could teach you a thing or two now.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You're wasting your breath.
I have to talk to you.
Nigel, get lost.
Throw him out.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Balefire on you, Selena!
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Cigarette?
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
That's home.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Where is inner space?
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
What's it like?
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
For what?
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Not yet.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Cheap but effective.
A cheap trick.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
I don't scare that easily.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
Who are you ?
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
That was meant for me!
Zaltar!
Goodbye...
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Better than when I was a child.
You can use the wand.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
You're going to take me back?
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Then come with me.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Then teach me how.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Why?
But it's impossible.
I knew it!
There is a way.
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Zaltar, please help me.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
That horrible woman!
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
You look at them? How?
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
It's lovely. . .
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
What? Palace? Hardly.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Criminals.
Others?
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
I know.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Shouldnt've done that.
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
I was on Earth...
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
What is this place?
