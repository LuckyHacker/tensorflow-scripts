I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
The Shawfish?
No, I'm going.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Very good.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
And I'll have the special fish.
Uh-huh
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Are you ready?
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
And go to confession.
Okay.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Yes.
Have I been a good wife?
His brother.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
I'm going to bed now.
You're welcome.
Thank you, Rose.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
What?
Cosmo?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Where you been?
Why you drinking so much?
Rita. Pass the wine.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
I don't wanna talk about it.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
I won't pay for nothing.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
I have no money!
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
I don't like him.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Who's dead?
No. You were there.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
Rose, pass the wine.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I don't wanna talk about it.
And that's how much I'm saying.
You haven't said anything.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
I don't know what you mean.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I have my eyes open.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
Hi.  Hi.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
You're my father.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You're married.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I got it done.
What'd you do to your hair?
Mona?
Let's go tell your Mother.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
It's temporary.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
Here.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Yeah.
He did?
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Maybe.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
I didn't give you away the first time.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
I won't come.
In a month.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
Johnny Cammareri.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
He got hit by a bus.
What killed him?
The guy died.
You did this once it didn't work out.
Yeah.
Again?
I'm getting married.
What's your news?
You look tired.
Ti amo.
Here.  Ti amo. 
Pop, I got news.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
You're not sleepy?
Bed.
Where's Ma?
I'm wearing your bracelet.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Why you looking around so much?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
Oh, Cosmo!
I brought you something.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
And what did they say?
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Yes!
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Hurry up.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
You have too many dogs.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Good morning, Lucy.
It's wrong to just let them go.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Will you marry me.
What!
Loretta?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
Loretta, what are you talking about?
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
No, I'll tell him.
Ronny, please...
No. I'm gonna wait.
You've gotta get outta here.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
He's coming.
Is Johnny here?
Ronny!
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
I'm freezing to death.
No.
Let me go home.
No.
Let me go home.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Why not?
And you're not now?
I was.
I'm afraid of who I am.
Why?
I'm really afraid.
Yeah.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
Yeah.
This is where we're going!
That's right.
This is your place.
We're here.
You're late!
I'm here!
He didn't come!
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
I know what I know.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
You're making me feel guilty again.
How can you ask me that?
What's the matter?
Yeah. It smells like snow.
It's really cold.
I wanna go home.
What do you want to do now?
I think that's it.
No thanks.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
Yeah.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Awful?
That was just so... awful!
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
It's the best thing there is.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
Come on.
So. Where are we sitting?
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
For what?
Thank you!
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Kinda gaudy.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Who painted that?
Thank you.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Hi.
Hi.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Alright.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
What are you talking about?
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What?
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
But that's cause he don't know!
But he wants me to come!
I'm telling you you can't.
I'll come to the wedding.
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I can't!
Snap out of it!
I'm in love with you!
Why not?
I can't do that!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
What?
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Oh no I didn't!
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
You ruined my life.
What did I do?
What did you do?
You don't get along with anybody!
She didn't like me.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
I'm marrying your brother!
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
Don't just become excited.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
Take it easy.
What? What have we done?
What?
Oh my God.
It makes you look like an angel.
I've never seen a moon like that.
It's so bright.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
That light.
What?
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
What about Johnny?
Get all of me. Take everything.
I've got you.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Loretta.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
Your blood.
I was dead, too.
I was dead.
Me neither.
I can't believe what is happening.
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
To the bed.
Where are you taking me?
Son of a bitch!
A wolf without a foot!
A bride without a head!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Because I have no Luck!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
No!
Stop it!
I'm telling you your life!
What are you doing!
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I'm a wolf?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
You don't know nothing about it.
You really are stupid, you know that.
Yes.
You think so?
She was right to leave me.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Why you talking to me?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
Stupid yourself.
Just Johnny.
How many men since then?
Seven years ago.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Stupid.
No.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
I don't know.
Why what?
Why?
Yesterday.
When you get engaged?
Instantaneous.
Fast.
Bus hit him.
How'd he die?
He knew my husband who died.
Where'd Johnny find you?
Loretta.
This is good. Uhh...
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
I like it well done.
I know that. I do what I want.
You don't have to help me.
I'm making you a steak.
Loretta. What's that smell?
I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
That's it.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
Maybe I should come back another time.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
I don't understand.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Excuse me.
I have no life.
Yes. Do you want...
You are going to marry my brother?
I'm going to marry him.
Why?
Yes.
Have you come from my brother?
Let me come and talk to you.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
He's in Palermo.
Why didn't he call himself?
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Johnny.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You? No.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
Hi.
Hi Loretta.
Yeah, I'll be in.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Bye, Aunt Rita.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Right.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
I got things to do.
Where's the ring?
What?
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
I must ask for that back.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
If I marry you my mother will die.
WHAT?
Loretta, I can't marry you.
I have no secrets from my family.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
We should talk alone.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Have you told her we're getting married?
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
How was your plane ride?
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
Sure.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
You have a brother?
He's my younger brother.
Who is he?
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Yeah.
A month from today?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
How about a month from today?
Then let's set the date.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
How near is she to death?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
What about the wedding?
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
Seven-thirty.
What time is it?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
I like this ring.
Alright.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
This is a good suit.
Yes, on the floor.
On the floor?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
I don't understand.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
What do you mean?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
Yes?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Bobo, take the cart away.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
I shouldn't.
Have Something.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
What's the matter?
Never is a long time.
You never have dessert.
She was too young for him.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
Maybe you're right.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
No?
You don't want the fish.
Oh God, that's too bad.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Do you love him, Loretta?
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
It was a miracle.
WHAT!! She was dying!
She recovered.
He's with his dying mother!
No more he's not.
What? He's in Sicily!
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Where's pop?
No. But I have a hangover.
No. Are you drunk?
Are you drunk?
Everything's different.
Your hair's different.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
What the hell happened to you?
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
A wife knows.
What! How do you know?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Where you been?
Hi.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Did he tell her?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
How's the mother?
No. He don't.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
And we'll sell the house.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
I got married before, you didn't sell.
So we'll sell the house.
Pop don't like Johnny.
Why not?
No.
Will you live here?
Pop.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
No.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
We just come from the bank.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
Hi, Loretta.
You gotta date?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Oh.
No.
Did you see it?
What about the moon?
What's the matter with him?
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Hi.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Alright.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
I know.
You should think about this.
I know.
That's a pretty big sin.
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
What sins have you to confess?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Did you see the moon last night?
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Talk to him.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Don't make yourself sick.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Don't fight.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
I don't know.
He should pay.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Don't fight.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
Okay, I'll tell her.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
No idea.
You don't know where Loretta is?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
I don't know.
That's it! That's the reason!
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Who was that?
Yes.
That's incredible.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
You're kidding?
My mother's recovered.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
Maybe I should go?
Yes.
It's late.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Where is she?
So.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Come on in.
I came right from the airport.
Moving in?
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
It was a miracle!
I'm sure she did.
Of course I want to.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Good.
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Johnny...
Loretta...
It's nothing!
Thanks, comrade.
Absolutely!
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
What happened?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
I am alone in the world.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Sure!
May I presume to ask you a question?
Definitely!
Can I get another one of these?
But absolutely!
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Yes?
Good night.
I'm freezing
Sure.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
Good night.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
I'm too old for you.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm a little cold.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
People home.
No.
I guess you can't invite me in?
Yes.
Temperature's dropping.
Yes.
You knew that man?
Sure.
May I walk with you a ways?
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
I think it's because they fear death.
Nerves.
Why do men chase women?
Go ahead.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm a housewife.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Don't shit where you eat.
Yes.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
That woman was a student of yours?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
What do you do?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Are you sure?
Will you join me for dinner?
Sorry. That was rude.
None of your business.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
She was just too young for you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Well. That explains it.
He's a plumber.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
It's a house.
My God, it's a mansion!
Yes.
You mean the whole house?
That's my house.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
I knew she had it.
She's got it.
Oh. Right.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
You see that moon last night?
You got me.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
You were a tiger last night.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I don't know.
What would he be doing down there?
Cosmo.
Is who down there?
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Oh.
Look.
What? What?
Rita. Rita.
Marriage is happy news.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
