I know, but...
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Yeah.
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
It's Nick!
What the --!
It's gotta!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
I thought that was it.
Jesus, it's freezing!
They did too!
They did not!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
You're full of shit!
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit.
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
It is too! Now you passed it!
It is not!
I'll get it! Where is it?
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Yeah, Sal--
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Damn right!
Yeah.
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
Nick...
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
He's real bad, Nick.
Worse since she talked to who?
Fucking A.
You mean...?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Tell him, Vince.
Married?
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
I got delayed. I --
Jesus!
Whee-uu!
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
That's new, isn't it?
Here. Hit it here.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
It won't open.
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
No.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
You talk to him?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Where? Where is he?
Sure. Why not.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Yeah.
You're back.
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Where is he???
You are his friend.
Yeah.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
I came to see Merle.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
No. None of that.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
See, I'm going home.
You are frightened, no?
I have to go.
But I insist.
No, I --
But you must come in.
I have to go.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
You call me Linda, just like home.
Linda, yeah.
You like to call me Linda now?
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
You mean...?
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Everybody love Linda.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Too bad.
No.
Get anything?
Oh. Fine.
How was huntin'?
Thanks.
She's in back.
Now he's back.
Yeah?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Yeah?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
You know a guy named Merle?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Naw.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Inside, Vince.
Where's it gone?
Psst. Vince!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Hey, Nick...
Vince!!!
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Holy shit!
Who's got the ammo?
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Oh, well...
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Hey, guys...
Oh, Jesus.
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Nick, she won't say why.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Sal's alive???
Kind of. You didn't know?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Sal.
Worse since she talked to him.
No?
Not so good.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
No?
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Rough, huh?
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
Biederman!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Biederman, yes.
You Biederman?
Here.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I'm just so lonely.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
I don't know.
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
I see you're going hunting.
What?
You're going hunting?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
What are you doing?
Right here.
Nick?
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
No-o-o!
Oh, it's great. Fine.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Naw, it's... I mean...
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Frost.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
How's the trailer?
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
But --
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
How are you?
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
No.
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
I don't know.
What kind of beer would you like?
Sure.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
I don't know! I don't know either!
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Would you?
Okay.
Will you marry me?
What?
Linda, Linda...!
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Oh... You know...
Linda, what's the matter?
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda...
Nick.
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
And then you...
We... Three bullets.
Playing?
Playing.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Up north.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
I... No. You do this for money?
You seem... disturbed.
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Right here.
Merle?
Merle, I wanna go home!
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
This is horrible!
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
I want to go home, Merle.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
No. No, no.
You can do it, Sal.
Who the hell knows!
Who the hell is he?
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
I like it, Nick.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
How's Linda?
Sit down.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
No. No way!
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
No way. No fucking way!
Three bullets -- minimum.
How many bullets?
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
More bullets in the gun?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
We what?
We gotta play with more bullets.
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
Merle...
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Forget Sal?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
What do you mean?
Forget Sal.
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
What do you think?
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
I'm doing that too.
I thought you might be praying.
What else?
What are you, hoping?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What are you, God?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
Hunt with Vince?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Huh?
Hey, Nick?
It's ahead, Vince.
It's ahead, by the tree.
You got it.
Promise! You gotta promise!
Merle --
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Yeah.
From Nam?
You think we'll ever come back?
Well, where's he from?
Hell no!
Is he from here?
Oh.
Pow.
Pow?
Pow.
What'd he say?
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
From Nam?
Nick, he just came back.
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
What do you think about?
Yeah... I guess.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Fucking A.
The shot?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Yeah.
You think about it?
Yeah.
You do?
So do I.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Huh?
I just wait. You know?
Yeah.
That way it sets.
I know.
You should have put that on last night.
Right.
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
There's Vince!
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
That's it. No. No way.
What do you mean, no???
No.
No!!!?
No.
Then lemme have 'em.
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Here! This is it!
Watch it, shithead!
Here, here! This is it!
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
You wanna bet?
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
Yeah!
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
No.
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
Phantom Mary?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Yeah.
Merle gave me this?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
It's Merle, Sal.
It's not socks, Sal.
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
Here. Behind you.
Where?
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
You didn't get a deer?
No.
Did you get one?
Yeah.
Did you go hunting.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
I gotta get back, Nick.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
What?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
See you Monday.
See you Monday.
That's my plan.
Great. That's great.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Right.
Don't worry what it says in the book.
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
Where's Vince?
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
The fuck I did!!!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
Sure.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Yeah.
You're full of shit!
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Never one.
No!
No.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Naw.  Uh-huh.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
What's it for??
What the hell's that for?
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
That's who.
Cynthia! Sure.
Aw, it's a long story!
Well, who'd you get married to?
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
Up.
Up a little there... What would you say?
Down ribbon!
Down.
Down I would say... What would you say?
Up ribbon!
Up.
Up I would say... What would you say?
