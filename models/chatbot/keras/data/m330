Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
What?!
I'm moving out.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
Went --
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Yes!
You thought it was me?
Where is she? Is she all right?
Al!!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!
How's your mother?
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
No.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
They celebrated the common person.
Yeah, so... ?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Who?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Come on...
What do you love her or something?
Yeah. Ma...
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Anything good?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
At what point?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
No! Do they show you having sex?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
Do they show it?
What if I'm vomiting?
What if--you're vomiting?
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
You know it.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
What?
You know what would be great?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You think she really likes him?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
So?
This is real, Bananahead!
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
Okay, I'm nuts.
You're nuts.
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
What?
Did you see that?
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
I don't think so.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Ed --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Ed --
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Leave her be.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Ed, do you want my advice?
What if Shari's the dream?
Great line.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Yeah.
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Yeah?!
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
They tore her dress! ...
A woman wants to be pursued.
Sure.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Yeah?
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Uh-huh?
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
How you doing, Ed?
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Yes, Ed.
I do.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
No, uh...
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Um, yeah -- thanks.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
I want you to take this.
Cool.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Excuse me.
Ed, can I see you a second.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
What did you study?
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Where are you going?
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Good luck.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Take him off the air.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
This guy.
He's who we want to go with.
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Al!
Who?
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
I ... don't know. I ...
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Really? They were..
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...

Mm...  Oh, man...
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Thank you. Can I see her?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Yes?
Mr. Pekurny.
Oh.
So he killed himself.
Right.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Right, right...
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
When? Today?
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
What?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Your brother's here.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Tell me.
You know who we are?
We're falling behind.
You said that.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
What?
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Ma...
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Ed! How did you know I was here?
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
But Al is your husband now!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Why? How...
Oh my god! On TV!
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
The doctor said you were having sex.
What?
So you had sex with him?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Who?
It was horrible. He called me up.
What happened?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
St. Joseph's.
Oh God. What hospital?
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
What's the matter?!
I'm at the hospital.
Mom?
Eddie...
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Who?
And what did he come back now for?
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
What's the difference?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
She had white shoes.
Could've been a nurse?
She could've been a nurse.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
He says --
He had girlfriends!
Holy sh--
Both.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Yes.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
Oh my God!!
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Mm.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
How's Marcia? She all right?
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
No! And that girl has a name.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
He made a mistake.
Hey, he cheated on her.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
No. It's a mess.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Send him away.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah?
Eddie? ...
She wouldn't tell me.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
What are you talking about?
She won't.
Well, when will she be back?
She left.
What is she, at work?
No.
Hi. Is Shari here?
Shari, Ray feels --
Hi, Mom. 
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Right, yeah --
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
What's going on over there?
All right. Let them decide.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
I can't?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
What are you doing?
Our foibles, our foibles!
Our what?
They're gonna mock our foibles.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
Never would be plenty.
How much less?
He's just ... trying a little too hard --
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
What does this mean?
No, I mean...
Are you asking me?
Welcome to work, Ed.
Hey, Lou.
Who's in it?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Well, then I'm quitting.
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
You batted or you bunted?
I batted!
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
What do we have to do?
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
It's nice.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
What did you do to your hair?
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
Kinda'.
Come on.
This is going right up your ass.
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
Everybody's someone.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
What?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
The what?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
No... Could you?
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
No. It's your fault.
It's not their fault.
...yeah?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Are you all right?
I need to talk.
Come on...
Okay.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Somewhere.
Where?
Come on, let's go.
I'm sorry.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
So?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Ed?
Really? 
There's a list.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Twenty-nine.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Ohh...
Page three of the Post.
Look at this.
No. Who?
Everybody hates me!
Shari...
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
So...?
... yeah, then, but...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
I really like you too...
Shari, I really like you...
I know, I ...
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
What?
Um...
He could give me some oxygen.
Why?
I wish my stepfather was here.
Saturday, I think we should
That's lucky.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Oh yeah.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
The what?
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Yeah, well...
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
I missed you.
What are you doing?
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Oh God, this is so weird.
Really?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Really?
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Go!
Can't we just --
Leave. Go.
Well, when you put it that way.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
It's... okay
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Really?
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
I mean bad.
Oh... how come?
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Okay ...
Ha!
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
What do you want?!
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Right.
You do though, you look great.
Dynamite is dangerous.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
So?
Dynamite.
Cream rinse?
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Why do it?
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Are you sure about this?
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Yeah...
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
Me?! That's you!
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
You know what your problem is?
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Come on, Ma.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Me?!
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
Ray, come an--
Good-bye, brother!
Cassie...
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Save it.
Look, we gotta talk.
I know.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Yeah.
... Ray?
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Please!
You brought the girl!
You brought the cameras here!
Why me?
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
We'd better go...
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Yeah...
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
You watching the ballgame?
Hi.
It's me, Ed.
Who is it?
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Great.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
What's the dif --
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Oh, Jesus.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Ray --
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Marcia's living with a singer?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
No. What happened?
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
Polish acrobat.
Yeah.
Yeah?!
All right.
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
I don't know.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Screw off.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
I'm doing all right.
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
What?
Why do you do that?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
You would do this? You would actually --
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
What?
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
I got your message. Way to go!
We're excited.
I'm making a tape.
Thumbsucker!
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
You're in show business?
Show business.
What is?!
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What are you drunk?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What?
You know, that would be like a great thing.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
Where were you?
What's up?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
No -- keep it.
No problema.  You want a picture?
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Who's --
Who's Shari?
Hi, Shari.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
Do you still have it?
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
The pirate ship.
What...
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Ed... I'm sorry.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Oh, man! So...
Check forging.
What...
No. Two times.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
I was in jail.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
It's Ed.
Who is it?
No. Am I supposed to?
You don't recognize me.
Hi.
Hello.
Yeah. Why?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Ed?
Ohhh...
Mm.
Good?
Mm.
What is? Oh, dinner!
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Can I help with anything?
Sure.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
No.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Hm?
We have to stop meeting like this.
Oh!!
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Thanks... That's ...
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Hi.
Hi.
What?... Why?
That girl's an idiot.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
What does that have to do with... ?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
How?
That's the point -- this could change things.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
We don't have foibles.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
By the X.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Sign here, please.
