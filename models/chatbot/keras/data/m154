Naw. That's over with.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
I never said any of that!
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I wrote. Not every week...
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Yeah, I know.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Great ass.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Who's that?
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Who gave you this idea?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Why?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
You... in the Navy?
I joined the Navy.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Neither have you, pard!
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Hi, Byron.
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
Thank you, sir!
Okay, okay. You win.
What for?
Come back here, kid!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Great.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
I been calling for four months.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
Yes, sir.
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
Yes, Sir.
You, Zack?
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Zack, we've got to go.
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Good morning, girls.
Great. You can go in my place.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
I don't mean anything by it.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
A long time ago.
When did this happen?
Yes, Joe.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Come over here where I can see you.
Joe!
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Well, goodbye.
I know.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
You're good.
Yes, sir!
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Aw screw it...
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
It's important, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Yes, sir!
Mayo, are those your friends?
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Pity you don't have the character.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
No, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
I want to fly jets, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly, sir!
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
I want your D.O.R.
I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Not exactly, sir.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
What's your name, boy?
No, sir!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Zack, don't!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
No, sir.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Where are you from, boy?
No, sir.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
No, sir!
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir.
No, sir!
No.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
I didn't call you anything before that.
Before that.
I called you Sarge.
What did you call me, boy?
Pardon?
What did you call me?
How're you doing, Sarge?
Hi, son.
Yes, sir!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Yes, sir!
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Yes, sir!!
Louder!
Yes, sir!
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Yes I do!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
What are you tired from?
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I said, come here!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Well, I'll be goddamned.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
What?
Sid, there's no baby.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
You what?
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
What other issue is there, Sid?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
How late?
I'm a little late, that's all.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Then, I'll see you around.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Or we could do that yeah.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
You're sure it's okay?
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Something tells me you've been here before.
We don't have to talk at all.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Yeah.
Vietnam?
He was. He died.
Is your brother a flyer?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
No! That's not true!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
God help you, Lynette!
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Lynette, where's Sid?
I do.
No. I never feel like that.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
No way... Would you?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
What do you mean?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
I haven't made up my mind.
You serious about having him over?
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
You hope.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
He ask you out for next weekend?
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
How did it go with you guys?
But in what ways?
Everything was different.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Yeah... Mmmm...
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Great.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
I got my foot on the floor.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Come on. Let's go dance.
That was you guys, huh?
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
One more minute.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
And you turned him down??
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
What did you tell him about the baby?
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
That's brilliant.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I bet you do!
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Because he's my friend, too.
Why?
I'd like to come with you.
I don't know where that is.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Why'd he do it?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
So?
I'm looking for Sid.
I know that.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Twenty-two years ago.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Your real father?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
What would you do differently?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
No. Is that what you want?
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
That's okay. I'm used to it.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
No, they're for your mom.
Are those for me?
Hi.
When I'm good and ready.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
What's the matter?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Does it still hurt?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
God.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
What's stopping you?
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I don't want you to move.
I'll get it if you want.
Want me to get a towel?
It sure was.
That was great.
Any time, sailor.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
I've never had a girl.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
You're better than candy.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
That's it?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
I know who you are and what you want.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
I'm starving.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
You stayed after all.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
Be a friend. Leave.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Forget it. Just get out of here.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
There's always a choice.
He didn't give you much choice.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
My kinda group!
I vote for the motel.
Me, too.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Do you go to school?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Not me.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
You got a girl?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Really?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Seriously.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
He said he grew up poor?
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
Yeah. All week long.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Hey, Sid, thanks.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
I can't risk it.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
How do you figure that's your bunk?
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Sid, what happened?
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
It's mine.
Do you know that for sure?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
But she expects you to marry her?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
But it can't wait.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
No problem, but who's Susan?
Thanks for covering for me.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
A little.
That isn't true, is it?
Naw.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Yeah.
Hey, you guys still awake?
Sure.
You okay?
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Shhhh...
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Could you believe those girls!
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Jets.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
I've seen better.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
