Innocent of what?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Like whores?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
I fined 'em instead.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
But what they done, they...
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
No?
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
Thank God.
Rain's coming.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
We was... lyin'.
You told them cowboys you had it.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
He said...
What wife? He don't have no wife.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Ah, I see.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Maybe he ain't so tough.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
What'd he say?
'Course he's coming.
He's coming ain't he?
Building his porch!
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
He give 'em names?
Nope.
He tell you where them others is?
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
She back in Kansas?
Yeah, I guess.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Yeah. See?
Your wife?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
You want... a free one.
Oh. Yeah.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Free ones?
Advances?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Are you really going to kill them?
That big guy lookin' for me?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Three days? I must be.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Oh. How long I been here?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Scouting?
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
You ain't dead.
I thought... you was an angel.
Oh yeah.
Mmmm pistols.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Be careful with those, sonny.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Oh.
Books. He's my biographer.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Shit and fried eggs.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
He admit it?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Alive?
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
I could run off them whores.
You could run off them two cowboys.
That much, huh?
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
They really got all that money, them whores?
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
All week?
Yup.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Yeah?
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
What's all that wood?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Hit your finger, huh?
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Property.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
No?
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
What's your name?
Like I said, I...
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
What?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
Did you... kill him?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Give it to him.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
Is... is it... loaded?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
But... if he doesn't miss?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
And?
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
But he was called...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
You were there?
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Duke.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Uh... Duke.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
The... Duck of Death.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
It's only a b-b-b-book...
Letters?
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
N-no, sir?
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Then... what?
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
What'd Ned say?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
A sign on him?
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
Who killed him?
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
He's... he's dead.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Ned's share?
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You could have it. All of it.
You better get on back, Miss.
You... gonna take... the money?
Sure. Sure, Bill.
Lemmee see it.
Wha... what f-for?
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
I trust you, Bill.
We all got it comin', Kid.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
Take a drink, Kid.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Yeah?
First one I ever killed.
First one what?
That was... the first one.
Yeah.
Say, Bill...
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Yeah, I guess so.
Just SHOOT!
I can't see 'em.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Yeah.
Did... you... get... him?
Yup.
Is it him?
You can shoot him.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yup.
Tell me right off if you see him.
He's in there.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yeah, he's in there.
You still think he's in there?
It's gonna get riper yet.
Shut up, Kid.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
After a ways.
When we gonna double back?
Yeah.
They takin' water?
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
He ain't killed.
I got him.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Better re-load it.
What happened, did you hit him?
Shit!
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
Did you kill him?
He got the boy's horse.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Finish him, Ned.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
Get some sleep, Kid.
You don't recollect!
Well... I don't recollect.
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
What business?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Lookin' at?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Huh?
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
You're goin' back with him?
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
No.
Three ways, I figured.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Oh.
Been gone near three years now.
Huh?
She's passed on, Kid.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Jesus!
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
What for?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
About what?
Well, how about it?
Oh.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
He said that, huh?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Maybe I ain't.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Yeah, I guess so.
I could of... easy.
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
William Munny, yeah.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Yeah?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Huh?
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Yeah.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
You sure you ain't armed?
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
You ain't shot.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Two.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Easy, Bill, easy.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Easy, Bill.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Worms was comin' out.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
He's dead, Bill.
I seen him.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Yeah?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
No.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
Yeah... you said that last night.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Jesus.
How far kin you see?
Shit.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
HEY, KID.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Beats the hell out of me.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
He hit you?
Yeah.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
You ain't like that no more.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
You ain't like that no more.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Well, she...
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
She gave me the evil eye.
Sally?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
He musta been movin' right along.
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Three ways?
This Kid, what's he like?
Two weeks, I guess.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Eleven.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Who said that?
K-k-kill somebody?
What?
No... I meant...
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Did I what?
Did you... did you... ?
Well, I come back, didn't I?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
The Kid, yeah...
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Tom?
That fella come by... Tom.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Three.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Hullo, paw.
Best we move that pig.
Who's he?
Two more hogs got the fever.
What is it, son?
Hell, yeah.
Yeah?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Just like that?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
An' if I spot 'em?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
That ain't what I mean.
We'll bury him.
Well, suppose he does?
Maybe.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
We done that stuff.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
That was your idea, I wanted to...
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
His pistol must of jammed.
Plenty of times.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
How many you killed, Kid?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
I don't like the question.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Yeah.
Say, Ned... ?
I ain't blind, you asshole.
He's blind, for Chri...
Fuck you.
See that scrub oak yonder?
More.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
Far enough.
I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
Yeah?
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You gonna share your half with him?
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Nothin's bent.
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Thought you was followin' me.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
