I'll pose any way you want.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Whaddya mean?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Are you a virgin?
What!
Walter can I ask you something?
You're breaking my concentration!
A girl with a body like mine?
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
Um...
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
I already told you I'm not.
Not even a little bit?
N-no...
Are you nervous, Walter?
Oh it's enough...
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
I'm almost ready -
Shh!
It's kind of dark -
Uh-huh.
What, right now?
Tonight.
Yeah.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
I didn't finish talking to you!
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
What are you doing here?
I'm going home!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Oh yeah?
That's not true I am a sculptor!
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
I just might.
Would you like to do me?
Not anymore!
Don't you work here?
Righto.
See you later -
He made a cat.
What did he do?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What the hell's going on?
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Is the manager cooperating?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Anything new?
Alright we're clear.
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Walter...stay away from me!
There's...a body inside that statue!
What?
Walter...there's...
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Just about anything, Walter.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Forget it.
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Why not?!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
No! I want to talk about it now!
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Walter, I'm sorry...
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
What are you trying to say?
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Carla -
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
I like you very much, Walter.
That means you like me!
Of course I do!
You think I'm creative?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Hm...
Nice night out...
Bye!
Goodbye.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Are you ready?
Thank you.
I mean, you look so pretty.
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
I know what it is to be ignored.
Every word...
It's true, isn't it?
All about me...
Yes Walter.
Did you hear what he said?
Sorry...
Walter!  Jeez!
May I please have another little kiss?
There there...
Where where...
Here here...
More champagne, your majesty?
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Better!
Is it murdered man?
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Oh yeah?
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
What's up, Walter?
Oh...
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Carla...
Hi Walter.
Now you're a professional!
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
It wasn't easy.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Me too.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Let's see it.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Look at the size of it!
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Murdered man.
What's it called?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Great!  What is it?
Of course...it's wonderful.
You really like it?
Honest?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
A thing I made.
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
I'm honored to know this man.
Walter...I can't believe it.
When did you make this, Walter?
Put it in the middle of the room!
Hm.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
It was.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Here you go, enjoy.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
That's word for word.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Would you pose for me for free?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
Why not?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
I admit it.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
Don't ask.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Nothing...nothing at all.
What's the matter with you?
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Are you alright?
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Murdered...man?...
I'm totally serious!
Are you trying to be funny?
Leonard, what are you doing?
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Maybe so...
What are you doing here so early?
Hi Walter...
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Yeah, right outside the door!
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
No man I'm on my own plane.
Didn't you hear him?
What did he say?
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Man this is heavy!
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Let's check out the scene.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Man look at that get up !
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
There's that weird dude again.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Now what kind of statue was that?
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I wonder what his deal is.
I know, man.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
I know, man.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I know, man.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I know.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Not only that, he copied us!
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I do the research.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
Yeah?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
Never mind...
Well, w-what did you do?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Put it down, Walter.
Whatsamatter Leonard?
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Just wait till you see this!
What do you have in the box?
It was.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Yeah and what would I say?
You might talk too much.
Yeah, why?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
A show..how soon can we go?
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
You want me to open a window or something?
It's hot in here...
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
You didn't mean to what?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Well...why murdered man?
I-I already got a new one!
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
What, Mr. De Santis?
You know what that proves?
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
Hiya Carla.
They are?
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Have a seat -
H-have a seat?
Good night Walter.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Go home.
A parakeet?
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
I don't have another cat!
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Well...
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well I don't know -
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Enough already about it - get to work!
People seem to like my cat.
Sure!
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
Got carried away, huh?
I didn't mean to.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Yeah.
Dead Cat?
Dead Cat!
I said I did, didn't I!
You...made that?
I didn't buy it I made it.
Where'd ya buy that?
Huh?
What is it, your laundry?
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Walter, what are you doing?
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
No...look I'm busy...
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
I can't talk right now.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Excuse me I have to make a call...
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
Walter shut up and relax!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Relax!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
Turn around!
You're gonna shoot me!
I ain't going no place with you!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
You are?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Smack?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Telling you what?
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
C-connection?
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
Huh?!!!
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
You're like an undercover guy!
Police officer.
You can cut the crap.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
I also saw the girl give you this.
Yeah I did.
Did you see my cat?
Hm.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
Uh, sure.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Hello, Walter.
Uh, hi.
How ya doin'?
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
I thought you didn't respect money!
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
Why not?
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Hiya Maxwell.
After that we go no more!
Here here!
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Suit yourself.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
Good morning Walter!
Hi.
Uh, I don't know.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Maxwell.
Call me...Maxwell.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
I saw your...cat.
Yes, get rid of them...
Are you done with these?
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Well I'm overjoyed.
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Gee.  Thanks.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Then let me give you something then...
You don't have to do anything!
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
I don't think so Mayolia.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Well, I'll go home with you.
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
T-turned on?
It's like...you've turned on.
Really?
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
With Dead Cat?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Hello Mayolia.
Your work, the layers of irony.
What do you get?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
What's the matter with you!
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I was just straightening up the place.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
What's all the noise in here!
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Good night Walter...
OK Mrs. Swicker.
If you see him.
T-tell him that?
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Oh, OK.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
