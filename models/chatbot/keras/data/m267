... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Oh yeah, he's good.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Okay.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
This is my fiancee Maxine.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Yeah, okay.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
I don't know.
Who am I thinking of?
I never played a jewel thief.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Thank you.
Malkovich!
Malkovich.
John Makel...
Yeah.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
Tell your friends.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Please, have a seat.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I know.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
People make mistakes.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
You came up here looking for the portal?
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
I'm sorry for everything.
A better friend.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
The monkey.
The iguana?
It's Elijah.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
My God!
I love you so much.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I need a shower.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
You fell in love with her first.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
I'm a puppeteer.
What's that?
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
You bastard.
Tell her you need to see her.
Shut up!
Suck my dick!
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Don't forget me.
Me and John.
We?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
And he was with her.
Yes.
You were him last night, weren't you?
We wish.
Fuck Maxine.
What about Maxine?
Us, of course.
What's that?
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
You've always loved the animals.
You've always hated the animals.
No they're not.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
What?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What are you doing?
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
So how was it? What was he doing?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Why?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
How was it?
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Why aren't you at work?
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
We'll talk about it in the car.
I have to go back now.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back.
I'm scared.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Now?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
What?
I want to try.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
'kay.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Yeah. You want a beer?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Right.
The iguana.
The ferret?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
I was worried.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Did you eat?
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Were supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
Hi.
Hi.
Just an idea I had.
She's very beautiful.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hmmm.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Hmmm.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
We have to make it an early night.
Seven-ish
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
I... puppeteer.
Why, Craig. why?
I'm a puppeteer.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
May 11th.
Is the trial date set?
Yeah. Okay.
The monkey.
Which one is Elijah again?
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
What?
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Enjoy.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Morning.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
I know. I'm sorry...
That... was... no... simulation.
So how was it?
Let me try!
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Let me try.
Sure, after a fashion.
Simulates?
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit, yes!
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Maxine...
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
I am a trained performer.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
I said "yes."
Yex?
Yes?
Mr. Juarez?
Forget it.
Money, Miss Warts?
My name is Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Schwartz.
Pardon?
Schwartz.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
You're insane.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Dr. Lester...
Thank you, sir.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Dr. Lester. . .
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Yessir.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
No. I understand perfectly.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
No.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youre implying.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Security.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Let him try.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Lotte? Is that you?
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Lotte, this is so good...
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
You're glowing again.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
You're evil, Maxine.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
I've fallen in love.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
You're late.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
My God.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Sure. It'd be fun.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
What's he been in?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
It better be.
This is important!
No.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Please, let me explain.
Yikes.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Hi.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
You're a fag or a liar.
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
That's the usual?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
My tits?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
The usual, Barry.
What'll you have?
Yeah. But enough about me.
You married?
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Just.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Maxine.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Somebody told you.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Who told you?
I'm right?
Who told you?
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Why not?
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Yeah.
I just wanted to say hi.  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
What?
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
No, really.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Yes, well...
I wouldn't know.
Emily Dickinson.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Is that true?
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Moving story.
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Ha ha ha!
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Hello. Wendy.
Hello, Don.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Hush, sweetheart.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Two hundred dollars, please.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
You can be John Malkovich.
Can I be anyone I want?
No. Don't be an ass.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Fine. Let's drop it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Why are you being like this?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
But I think I have another plan.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
The Great Mantini?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
What kind of circumstances?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
I like that.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
A scary dream?
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
Impressions? Those are hard.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Vegas? What'd you think?
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Good morning, Lotte!
Think, Jew florist?
Thank you, Floris.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Yes, my dear?
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Fork ah did?
Forget it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Do you?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Says who?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Do you?
Do you dream often?
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Count me in.
But of course.
Do we get to wear a crown?
Anybody else?
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Why not? I need to get in there!
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
You bastard!
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
No.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No, I didn't know that.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
No you mustn't, my child.
I'm getting divorced.
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Oh, be still my heart.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
One hour.
We have to meet.
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
I have to see you.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Maxine...
I love you, Lotte.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
When?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Yes?
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Ah.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Yes, Hi.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Who needs dancing?
No.
Is there dancing?
Great then.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Never heard of it.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
What's the play?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
How do we do that?
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
She's not available.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
Yeah, I saw them
Did you see the reviews?
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Whatever.
Good-bye, Maxine.
Derek Mantini!
Yeah what?!
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
You've got to be kidding.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Bad dream, darling?
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Sleepy suddenly.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
He's a selfish bastard.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Vegas.
It's okay, my sweet.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Stay in him forever?
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Really? Yeah. Okay.
I'd love to see your work.
You mean with Malkovich?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You still there, sweets?
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
I'm getting better all the time.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Lotte called me.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Come on in.
What the fuck is going on?
Darling!
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Oh, Lotte...
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Whatever you're having.
Can I get you a drink?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
How'd you get this number?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Who's calling?
Mr. Malkovich?
Yeah?
Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
What want ye, girl child?
Captain Mertin?
