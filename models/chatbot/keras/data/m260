The boys need help.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Uncle Alfred?
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
What is it?
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Too late for what, dear child?
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Oh no, those things frighten me.
You certainly will not.
Eventually she married a young physician.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Alfred, are you...?
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
What is it?
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Pheromones?
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Coming on line now, sir.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Specify, please.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
That, sir, does not compute.
Women.
What seems to be the problem?
It's good to see you.
Right here, sir.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
I love you, old man.
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Yes?
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Not all heroes wear masks.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
I am as well as can be expected.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
But I can't can I?
Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Is there something wrong, sir?
Thanks.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
There's a lovely inn just down --
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
You have?
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
You are going back to school.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
I recognized the accent.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Oxbridge Academy?
I'm on break from-
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
Alfred's happy here.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
What are you talking about?
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
You'd be surprised.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
Hey, what's your problem?
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Keep it.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Please be looking for me.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
I don't know.  It just feels right.
What exactly are you doing?
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
Be ready for anything.
I'm afraid to ask.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Why?
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
This is easy.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
Divide and conquer.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
I didn't kill your wife.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
You're loosing your cool
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
I hate being lectured.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Winded, old timer?
From the other side of the equator-
If we could relay the sunlight-
Maybe he melted.
No sign of the snowman.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
She knows who we are.
We gotta get those locks changed.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
What are you talking about?
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
Just the beast.
No beauty...
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
Can he save her?
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
How did you...?
Definitely.
Umm-hmmmm.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I can make it.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
He'll be here.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
Surf's up.
Watch the first step.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I was just hanging around.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Mr. Freeze.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
People come first, Dr. Isley.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I see you knew him.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Dr. Pamela Isley.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
Well...um...her.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
I wish I knew.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
What?
Who's Ivy?
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
I wouldn't bet on that.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
You're not even listening to me.
Can I get some help over here?
And?
But soon...
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
No!?
I knew you could handle it.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
She wants to kill you.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Dick, don't push me right now.
Like hell you do.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
But he's never said a word-
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
What happened to his wife?
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
That's gotta hurt.
Not good.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Adam and Evil.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
You lie!
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Where is my wife?
Make yourself right at home.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
You will rescue my wife
Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Dear daisy, don't despair.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
No gun.  How disarming.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
Impressive
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
What say we turn up the heat?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
I find that unlikely.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
Then you never loved me?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
What do you mean?
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
I've got to stop him.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
How about dangerous curves?
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Well, I can respect your opinion.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Our work?
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
