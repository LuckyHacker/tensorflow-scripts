Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Listen.
Don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
So whatsa deal?
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
No.  I never smile any more.
Gene -- you smilin'?
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
You'll be okay.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Aw, hey...
Okay.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Yes, I would.
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Come on, what's under this?
Jesus, you're the man!
Yeah.
These seats come out?
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Don't call yourself fat.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Heidi, I'm dying.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
What about the kids?
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
It's okay... it's okay...
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
Well, how'll I get home?
Hey, don't take the car!
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
I love you.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Oh, yeah, I will...
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
What guns?
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
It looks like a whole roast.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Jenny?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Right.  See you sometime.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
It's my only chance!
Well, then...
Yeah... yeah.
Do you still want the operation?
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
That's good then.  You've found something.
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Yeah... yeah!
Are they on the phone still?
They won't talk to you.
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Look... who's on the phone?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
You don't have a choice?
I don't have a choice.
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Yeah.
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Shit...
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
What?
Would you do something for me? Please?
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
I know I am.  I know!
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
So!  Sal is with you?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
I like that... yeah!
Denmark?  Sweden?
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
What am I supposed to do?
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Why you going to Algeria?
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Where you gonna go?
I know!
You're really crazy.
That's it.
You're crazy.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
What trip?
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
Well...
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I'm sorry...
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I don't know what I'm doing.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
What are you talking about?
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
Yeah... I know.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
Yeah.  So how are you?
So... that sure is something.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
Yeah...
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
I'm really shakey.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Ooohh....
Well.... huh ...
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
How are you doing?
Hello, Sonny.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
You think it over, Leon.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
I'm afraid.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
I can't talk to him.
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
What kind of things, Leon?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
He's makin' threats in there.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
You try calling the police?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
Oh no!
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
I want to talk to him.
He's all doped up.
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
We're bringing in your wife...
Yeah?
Okay ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
What else?
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
You're full of shit ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Yeah ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
You tryin' to fuck me?
They were ...
What the fuck do you want?
Sonny, come on out!
What the hell you doin' back there?
I'll see what they'll do.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
The girl hostages.
What do you want?
Okay, what do you give me?
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Sonny, be reasonable!
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
He wanted to kill me!
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
Calm down, you're not ...
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
What?
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
... armed robbery ...
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Come on.  I want you to see something.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Okay, give us the women.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
You frisk me.
I frisk you?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Call me whatever you want.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Sonny-boy, one word?
Call me Sonny-boy.
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
What do you want to know that for?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
I got Sal.
How many you got in there?
I'm not alone.
You alone, or you got confederates?
They're okay.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
Who's this?
What are you doin' in there?
Yeah.
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
We're all set at Kennedy.
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
What now, Sonny?
You got Bank Americard?
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Are you a lawyer?
Yeah?
Mister Mulvaney?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Yeah.
Would I hire you?
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
We like you, too.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
I'm sorry.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
No you don't.
Sure - we like you.
You like me?
Special to me, too.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
They look like good kids.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
I'll be God damned if you will.
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
I'm not going.  I'm okay.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I don't know.
Do you think we can turn it on?

I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
Where's the air conditioning?
Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...
What now, Sonny?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
What?
I don't fool around with you.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn.  In spite of that bank insurance.  You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
If you take anybody, please take me.
What if I take you with me?
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
You got kids?
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Well, they go to guard school.
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
Mulvaney...
Now, you -- what's your name?
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
Where's the back door?
I took too long.
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
Hello, Mulvaney here...
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Give me the keys...
The gun's right on your back...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Howard, give him the keys...
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
My side, shit!
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
It's all we got.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Come on, lemme load you up...
What's the matter with you?
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
I must of been outta my mind.
I can take care of that.
Okay, is the vault open?
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Hey... let him out!
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
I'm glad it's okay.
Thanks again, Sam.
Okay.
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
You all right?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Everything's all right?  You okay?
What is it, Sam?
Hey.  It's raining.
You were terrific, too!
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
I didn't eat any pizza.
What about Howard?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Howard!
It's up to you ladies.
No, that's all.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Yeah.
Did you always call him Junior.
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
It was on the TV.
How did you know your son was involved?
Yes...
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
You're serious!
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
My body?  What for?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You shouldn't start now.
Pure?
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Because I don't want cancer.
You stopped?  Why?
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
I'm here.
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
All right. 
Okay, Sonny.
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Okay.
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
What'd he say?
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Sal?
Have him walk in backwards.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
What?
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
Get over there!
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Everybody!  Back here!
They're trying to come through the door!
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
I never been up in a plane before.
Yeah ...
Sonny -
Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.
Wyoming.
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
We're not there yet.
Does that still go?
We'd kill ourselves.
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!

What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
What kind of a deal?
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...

Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
All right ... let's go.
All right ... send them the guard.
To show that we're negotiating.
Alive.
Dead or alive?
He wants one.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
We won't have to.
But I want to know what you think.
I want him to think that.
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
But do you mean it?
I want him to think that.
... The bodies out the door.
What?
You mean that?
How'd that happen?
It's the cops.  Shit!
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
Goddamn women...
Get 'em in the vault!
Where's the money?
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
He's gone?
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
Let's go, Sonny.
Ah, Jesus...
Fuck him - let him out!
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Okay.  Which one goes?
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
You follow my car. 
Okay - you got your one.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Gimme the black guy...
What can he do, he's clean...
I don't want him.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
What's wrong?
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
I have to see.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
I want to talk to Leon.
I want them all.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Okay, when do I get them?
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Bullshit!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Fuck!  We did it!
Yeah - it looks real official.
Here's your document, Sonny.
Sonny - Here's your document.
Hey, let's get ready!
They're beautiful ...
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Hey, you okay?
... Just give me time to think...
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
I forgot she's in here.
What are you trying to pull?
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
Oh - Maria!
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
I speak what I feel.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Open this up!
I am.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Did Pop come down?
No!
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
Maybe...
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Oh.  Run.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
What'll you do?  Come out.
Not now, Mom, please.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
We can't stay here.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
I said you were never a faggot.
Oh my God, mother!
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
Of course not ...
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
You could give up.
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
Newsman, not ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
You're news, Sonny ...
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Robbing a bank.
Doing what?
Why are you doing this?
