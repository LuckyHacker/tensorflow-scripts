"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
You can go out there if you like...
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
Take your time.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Doubtful. What did he say?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
You must have been concerned.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
What happened?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
One hundred books?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Uh-huh. What are they?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
Really? You think so?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Hmm?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Good kids.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
How did they threaten you?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Me more than most.
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
A friend?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
Were you supposed to have a session?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Why's that?
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
What's that?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Uh-huh.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Could you come with me please?
Mr. Cook.
Dr. Mumford.
Not any more.
But you do therapy?
No, not really.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
I'm fine.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
...And I from Phyllis.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
Thank you.
I think he's got a point.
Ernest, what do you think?
What an asshole!
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
What's that?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
I see.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
What kind of doubts?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
How do you mean?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
My approach?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Are we?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Right now?
What are you doing for lunch?
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
I feel like we're making real progress here.
My pleasure.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
And the experiment is in here?
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
But you did come to me.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
What exactly is it supposed to do?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
Should I open it now?
It's a thought I had.
What is it?
You are so mean.
What's that?
Now we're back on track.
I was... never satisfied.
What?!
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
I didn't hear you.
Go to hell.
Where's your wife, Henry?
I never said that.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
No?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Why? I'm paying for this.
Stop now.
What?
Henry!
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Mr. Follett.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Good, then go.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Why not?
I don't want to hear any more today.
I have eighteen more minutes!
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
What brought this on?
Mr. Gilroy --
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Do you want to come in?
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
She seems very unhappy.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
What do you think's wrong with her?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Tastes good.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
A little.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
You've done well.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Althea hasn't told you?
What do you do?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I've had my moments.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
Nope.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
What?
I'm sorry, your honor.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Yes.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Yes, your honor.
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
I do.
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Well, come on in.
Yeah.
You do?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
What are they?
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
That's a lot of people all at once.
I'd better get in there.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
What?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Oh?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
What it might take is... doing time.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Okay.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
He told you.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Doc.
Lily.
Doc...
...so accomplished.
...so rich?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
You're on your own today, honey.
Where am I supposed to eat?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
Why do you watch?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
...And?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
And the Brocketts?
It's a pretty piece of land.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Doc.  Ainge...
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
You like me. How come?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Oh, I don't know...
How long you been in this town?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
What do you want to know?
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
It was Henry Follett.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
Who was that?
My patient had to leave early.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
You're right, as usual. See you.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Hello, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Sure I can, Lionel.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
-- Go on!
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
How are you?
Did you straighten her out?
Martin.
Hiya, Doc.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
Is she a friend of yours?
What's wrong with her?
Got to.
I'm trying.
Can you help Mom?
That would explain it.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
You're good.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Don't need it.
Got a license?  But no car?
Sure.
But you know how to drive?
Mother... go away!
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What kind of doctor are you?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Do you think that's a good idea?
We're going for a walk.
What's happening here?
Mumford... like the town?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Well, look who's here...
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Wow. You're something.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Well... you see, the problem is --
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Why don't you tell me?
I think you do.
No, I really don't.
I think you know what I mean.
What do you mean?
Finally, some common sense...
What?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What'd you want?
That's right, the fake kind.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
Will you be here?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you wait for me?
You got off easy.
What is your name?
Anything... just ask.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
Oh.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Will you think about it?
What?
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
But...
I am irate!
You deserve it.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
You feel violated?
You're not the only one...
...How violated I feel?
You probably got the idea.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Sofie...
Which show was that?
I guess you saw the show...?
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Mother...
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Hello.
Hello?
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Transference.
Transference!
What was that?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
I think so.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Okay...
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
I don't follow you.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I'm glad.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Um-huh.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Is it something you've heard about me?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
You're upset.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Of course.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
Of course.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I don't know if --
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
That's... good?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yeah?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
That's one way to put it.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Either one.
Which thing?
That's what I like.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
It's all right.
You like it?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
And he's where?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
So whose route is this?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
Is that when you split up?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Disgusting.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Yes.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
You're doing great.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Is that like a party trick?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Life.
Where?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Uh-huh.
Sore throat?
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Be specific.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Sorry... I'm done.
Is this the treatment?
Really? What would it take?
No.
I've offended you!
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
What?
Please... forgive me.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
Something's bothering her.
We don't discuss it.
Is she against you getting help?
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Mom's such a cutie.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
I'm not making any promises.
Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
Maybe you'll catch it.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
We'll work it out.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
What would you do?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
Even if you don't think it's real?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Hmm.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
No.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
What?
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
When did you start to feel this way?
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
What can you tell me about this?
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
He agreed?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Really?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
No again?
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
What did he want you to do?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
What'd he say?
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
Do you think that's what he wants?
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
Uh-huh.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
True. Should we stop them?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Was it something that happened at school?
What are you talking about?
What happened today?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
What do you want me to see?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
That's not quite what I said --
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Have women found you attractive?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
Where was this?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
It's my bit for the community.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's called pro bono.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
It's a big part of the show.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Weekly or monthly?
In maybe three or four issues.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Yep.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
What?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Yes, yes it does...
I guess that makes sense.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
I'm here for you, Doc.
Wow.
Sorry...
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Lily.
What'd I do?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Really?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
You want my advice? Far out!
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
You're completely reliable.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I'm honored.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
See you Thursday... regular time.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
English Lit.
Psych major?
No... no training.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
And a birth certificate is enough?
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
What about it?
All new people start with that...
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
That'd be Lily.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
And the drugs?
You and Candy...?
Things got a lot worse.
At least you pulled yourself out...
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
But look at me now...
You were messed up, man.
"Get to know your therapist."
Holy shit!
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Did you carry a gun?
It wasn't the best situation.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Sounds like you have several.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
What about everything? How did this happen?
I can tell you anything else.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
It matters to me.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Damn! What is your name?
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
Just you.
Who else knows?
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
It's not?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Definitely.
Really?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
You don't think I'm insane?
How's it coming?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
A doll?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Slash what?
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Jerking off?
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Okay... let's say that, for now.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
It's just a thought.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Yep.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Hey, Skip.
I wondered what happened to her...
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Uh-huh.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
This --
What?
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Amazing.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Well, there's Lily.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Don't you like this?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
This is exactly what I wanted.
This is great!
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
I've got three big ones.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I understand.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
Is that the question?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Nah... scotch.
Would you like another beer?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
How are you?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Yes... your particular approach.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
That was a terrible thing.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
When?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
