Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
Omar, listen to me--
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Omar--
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Your Raoul?
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
You hate Raoul?
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
We got any shots?
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
How long's it been?
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
Since when?
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
