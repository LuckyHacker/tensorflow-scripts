He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
How did you hear this?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Who took the meat?
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Many have.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
If we could speak alone.
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
I hit him square.
You must have missed your mark.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
Two days... ?  For murder?
They spend two days in chains.
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
What the hell are you doing?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Certainly not.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
What?
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
What of it?
Stains of blood.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
You will stay at her side?
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
You need rest.
Bring him.
You need to sleep.
Bring Young Masbath here.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
... Brom Bones...
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
A diseased monster.
He is a behemoth.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
What are you spying on?
We must be a curious sight to him.
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
What is that?
No bleeding.
To place it inside its coffin.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
I was afraid of this.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
Excuse me?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
They need guidance.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Your superiors are two days away!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
It is sacrilege!
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
Well... that might be... helpful.
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Master Hardenbrook...
Damn... damn... damn...
A fine idea.
Maybe you should take this.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
May we look at them now?
Hmm?  See them?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Do you have these persons' wills?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Pardon me?
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
I shall, gladly.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Not for lack of trying.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Chosen me?
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Very few, if any.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
The Widow Windsor.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
At times I do.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Listen to what you say....
I know it.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Well... so much for common sense.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
What is that you wear?
Believe?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
And now Jonathan Masbath.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
The militia?
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
Tired.
How are you?
I doubt that's the end.
What now?
Take the reins.
What can we do?
I know.  Hold on.
Lady Van Tassel...
Climb up!
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
This is farewell.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Why... why are you like this?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
What now?  Where is she?
But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
What books?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
No.  They are all missing.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
What was she doing?
Lady Van Tassel.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Did your father take a loan?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
What does it mean?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
In test... what?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Yes.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
What good is this?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
All I saw was their lantern.
Man or woman?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
Why this tree?
We should go.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Stay back.
What is it?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
True enough.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
Should we go back?
We should not go much further in this murk.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
What happened?
We are leaving.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
I hear nothing.
Listen.
What is it?
Witches do not exist.  However...
Father said witches live there.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Thank you.
I have others.  All I need is this.
No, I couldn't...
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
It's spectacular.
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
What kind of nuts?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Look again.
The Western Woods.
Out there.  What do you see?
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
What is it?
Up.
Where are we going?
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
How could he?
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
I'm sure I don't know.
What is the common thread between these victims?
I did not ask you to, did I?
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I manage fine alone.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
We have no choice.
I... I can't do this.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Quickly, close it.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Ichabod...
His horse.
What was that?
He moves too fast.
The church.
I do not know.  Away.
Where are we going?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Katrina...
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
What would you have me believe?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
I have not been able to face him yet.
What did he say, Katrina?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
And, what did he say?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
It was you there?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
Come with me.
What is so urgent?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What... what are you doing... ?
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
The skull is gone.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
My God... what has happened?
Just... keep where you are.
What are you doing?
What did you say?
Blood.
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
I apologize if I worried you.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
It is only me.
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
No, but... why do you ask that?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
What?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What has happened?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
What troubles you?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
To avenge his father, and the others.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
It was not butchery.
And this gives worth to butchery?
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
Must I hear this?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
What are you on about?
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
Why would you do such a thing?
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
They have done nothing of the sort.
People have put their trust in you.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
You promised justice.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
I insist that you have it.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
If you want.  But...
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
You made this, and the drawings?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
It would be interesting to find out.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
These scars.  How did you get them?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
You are funny.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
There is no such thing as magic.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Are you so superstitious?
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
He has proposed to me twice.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
My suitor?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Small talk.
Other people?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Let her go!
You cannot kill what is already dead.
What... ?
I know you saw me.
It is fine.  Now, I must...
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Very little.  I must be going...
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Where?
No.  She has gone out.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Use caution.
Yes, actually.
Returning to the Western Woods?
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Yes.  Here...
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Turn around.  Now!
What did you say?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
I didn't see none.
There was not much blood, was there?
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
I can show exactly.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
What... what are you doing?
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Can you help?
Sit.
The Horseman.  Yes.
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
In a way, yes.
You are from the Hollow?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
Father saw you die.
He rides tonight.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
You... you are alive.
Doctor, he is awake.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
No.
She has confessed.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She is guilty.
She did not do it... please listen...
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
May I see my mother?
Go home.
