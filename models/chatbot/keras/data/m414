Now Ann ...
Get the hell out of here.''!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
It's ... lovely.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... Â· organize an expedition -
Father ... Father!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Father!
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
I photographed it extensively, father.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
What have you got there?
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Ann ... Ann!
You're the animals - all of you!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Jack!...  Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
No! Don't!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Give it back!
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
We're leaving.
Jack!
Leave it, Ann.
It's the same image - Kong!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
There's a light up ahead.
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
I can't imagine you crying.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I want to thank you.
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Can you fly?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Where do I charter a boat?
No!
I'm sorry ...
Value? ... Value?
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Holy God! The mummy walks!
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
He's grubbing for money, father.
Oh my God ... Ann?
They' re dead.
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Two... maybe three.
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
I tell you it doesn't exist!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Man Eater!!!
That's too bad.
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
Native costume?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
The mountains?
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Yeah.
It must have been terrifying?
Yeah.
Did you fear for your life?
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Are you nervous Jack?
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
What?
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
They were just tasting the berries.
) They are now.
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Kong ...
That's your monkey, Denham.
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
An ape ... some kind of ape.
What was it, Jack?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Did you see her?
What's compassion, mister.
Compassion.
What's that?
Coz of something I lost.
Why?
Yeah.
Are you gonna start it up?
