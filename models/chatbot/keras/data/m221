Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
What happened to number five?
Take me to the hotel.
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
And you get a kickback.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Why not?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
What happened to them?
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
First time on Mars?
You're getting off to an early start.
The Last Resort.
So, where to?
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
What to the rebels want?
What was that?  An accident?
Welcome to Mars.
You got the job.
Over there man.
Where's yours?
He ain't got five kids to feed.
What's wrong with this one?
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
I think my grampa might be here.
But maybe you can change all that.
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Shut up and drive!
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Need a ride?
I'd advise you to hurry.
How'd you find me?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Who are you?
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
What do you want?
May I use your pen?
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Thank you.
I'll go encode your room key.
Identification?
Get it, please.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
Definitely.
Would you like the same suite?
Thank you.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
I am Quaid.
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
Do you expect me to believe you?
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Who is it this time--my mother?
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
So why am I still alive?
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
Fuck you.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
It's about goddamn time.
Kill him.
Don't be an idiot.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Yes, sir.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Stop fighting and get out.
Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
Yes, sir.
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Yes, sir.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
But I thought...
I know that.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
No, sir.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Come on...put his head in place.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
We haven't implanted it yet.
Why not?
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
I'm with an very important client.
You better get down here.
What is it?
Bob?
Forty-one A, Ernie.
Sleazy...and demure.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Brunette.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
Hetero.
Your sexual orientation?
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Eight years.
So, been married long?
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Two-headed monsters?
Nice to meet you.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
What is it?
Swallow this.
Suppose I do...then what?
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
You open it.
That's right.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
At Rekall.
Amazing.  Where are we?
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
I'm listening.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
What do you want?
O.K., everybody pull out!
Pull them out.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Arrest that woman!
HER!
There!  The woman!
Where?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Not since you lost him.
Any news of Quaid?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Melina!
They found us!  Everybody out!
C'mon!
Shit!
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
You're Kuato, right?
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
I don't know.
You tell me.
What, aliens?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Yeah.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
On his way.
Where's Kuato?
Sit down.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Relax, you'll live longer.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Harry, what the hell is this?
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Let me buy you a drink.
What are you, my father?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
I did?
You went to Rekall, remember?
What trip?
How was your trip to Mars?
Harry!
Hey, Quaid!
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
No shit...
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Why not?
Well don't.
I don't know.  Maybe.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Yeah.
Oh, Rekall.
They sell fake memories.
Rekall?
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
What the hell is this?
Look at this shit.
Come on!
I've got a lock!  There!
Up!
He's not at ground level.
Split up.  Find him.
I've got a weak signal over there.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
What is it?
Shit!
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Where is he?
I've got Quaid.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
Are you saying she liked it?
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I want that fucker dead.
Up to the right.
Where?
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Quit while you're ahead.
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Would you please repeat the destination?
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
The door opened.  You got it.
How did I get in this taxi?!
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Doug, don't!
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Bullshit.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
I love you.
I'm here at Rekall.
I suppose you're not here either.
Yeah.  Some of it was fun.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Clever girl.
It's time you found out.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
I'm honored.
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Beats me.  I just work here.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Bullshit.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Implanted.
And falling in love?
It was implanted by the Agency.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
The hell you're not.
I'm not your wife.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
Doug...
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
They did!  But I killed them!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Oh God, Doug.
--I got a trip to Mars.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Let me finish!
You went to those brain butchers?!
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
Some men just tried to kill me!
What are you doing?
Bye.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
I'm late.
Well...What do you say?
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Lori, move.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
All right, forget about it.
And you believe him?
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Just think about it.
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Move to Mars.
Do what?
Let's do it.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Lori...
You know I do.
...You mean it?
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Let me go!
But I'm always home by morning.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Tell me!
I don't know.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Nobody.
Who is she?
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Who?
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Mmmm.....
Is that better?
Let me go!
What's he talking about?
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
Go on.
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
Secret agent...How much is that?
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
I'm not interested in that.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I give up.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
No options.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
All right.
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
As real as any memory in your head.
How real does it seem?
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
What's in the two week package?
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
That a problem?
Right.  Mars.
Mars.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Nice to meet you.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
What's wrong?
Enough for everybody to breathe?
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
It's just up ahead.
You sure about this?
Aliens?!
Aliens built it.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
The one in the mine!
What reactor?!
The reactor.
Where are you going?!
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
You two-faced-bastard.
He's lying.
Oh, since when?
I don't need Kuato for that.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Like what?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
What can I do?
I saw them.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Not bad, for a hooker.
Just wondering.
I used to model for 'em, why?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Jump!
Now what?
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
So you dropped by to apologize?
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I thought you didn't like me.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I said get out!
Get out!
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
I'm not falling for it.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I think you better leave.
Inside what?
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Don't be ridiculous.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Why would I lie to you?
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Forget I said wife.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
She wasn't really my wife.
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
This is too weird.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
Not any more.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Hauser left me a note.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
What are you talking about?
I don't remember you.
There's something I have to tell you...
...What?
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
I guess he didn't.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I think it's still hungry.
Blondes.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
I love you.
I love you.
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
...Who are you?
What?
Wait!
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
I gave you?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
