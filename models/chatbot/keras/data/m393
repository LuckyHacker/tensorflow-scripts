No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Not on station time.
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
I know what I saw.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Jesus Christ ...
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
What do you mean?
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Hello?
That is the story of my life.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Wha .... ?
Your apartment.
So where is it?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Then tell me what to do.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
I don't know ...
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
What can we do?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Something bad.
And what did you discover?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Joey ... ?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
What am I looking for?
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Oh, Terri ...
Buying some drugs, alright?
Terri?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Sure.  Why?
Would you know this store again?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
But I don't know what's going on.
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Every day.
And he still sits there?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Who's that?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
How have you ... ?
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
I'll do it!
I'll boil some water.
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Taken what?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Did you know him?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
I'm trying to quit.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
What?
That's great.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Sorry.
Why are you so interested?
What is it?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Oh yeah ...
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
What?
Right.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
Right.  Right!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Uh-huh?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Where?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
What happened to him?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
I don't know.  Maybe.
You gonna buy?
Can we see?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
No.  We want ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
But you gave me a rose ...
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Unh-unh.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
No.  Thank you.
Wow.  Thank you.
Yes really.
No.  Really?
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
I'm sorry.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
A prize?  For what?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
Thank you.
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Uh-huh.
You're JP Monroe, right?
Welcome. 38
It has already begun.
How do we start?
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
But how in God's name ...
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Fuck you!
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Yes.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
What ... What ... ?
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Really?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Yeah right.  Look ...
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Oh, I don't ...
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Yes. 53
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
I miss you too.
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
You're apologizing?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Really?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
What do you want?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
JP?
Not quite.
Joey?
