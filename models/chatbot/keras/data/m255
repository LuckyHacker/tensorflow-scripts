Then that's it!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
New Jersey?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
Who're you?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
They're stealing my chopper!
There's another one we owe 'em.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
Not me. No way.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Planet 10?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
What?
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
We will, old fried, we will.
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Arachtoid.
Apache?
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
You're a welcome sight...
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
You okay?
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
What crate?
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
First thing I did.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Vanished. Thin air.
Then what?
Same one you had yesterday?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
I'm starving...somebody, help.
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
Where's the professor?
Dead.  Damnit!
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
What is it, Tommy?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
It?  Who does?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Let her out. In my custody.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
She wants a picture.
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Anybody we know?
Now!
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
The door's locked.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Got a casualty list?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Don't shoot!
And they got Penny!  Look!
To get my guns.
Where're you goin'?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
What? How do you know that?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Stay here, I'll be back.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
It's too dangerous.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Absolutely.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Go where?  Where're you going?
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Never.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
You don't wanna know.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Oh, my.
She was killed, Penny.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
Any time.
You keep an eye on it.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
Another 'you'?
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Which?  The one in my throat.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
No, I don't.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
It's kinda hard this way.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
The girl I remind you of.
Who?
Was she pretty?
Pretty terrible shot.
You.  Like the papers all say.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Go away.  Let me rot?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Everybody okay up here?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
He offered you money?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
This is so embarrassing...
Raise your hand...where?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
A what?
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Damn John Whorfin--!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
You look!  It's not here!
John Whorfin will kill us!
Not here!  No Overthruster!
I have a radio fix...
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Should we be on Code Red?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Better than him.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
What's his problem?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Asshole probably got lost.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Why me?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Pictures don't lie.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
It's a spittin' image.
I didn't drop 'em.
Pick those up, Reno.
Why me?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Bet I do.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Flying to Cambodia.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
So where's Buckaroo?
