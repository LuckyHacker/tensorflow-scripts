No.
Give me the keys.
It's our goddamn car!
It's my goddamn car!
You're not going to drive!
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
So?
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Twelve years.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
What're you saying, Charlie?
It's all there.  Both nights.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
We don't need you, Frankie.
What about tomorrow?
Take it now.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Your pay.
What's this?
Mondays.
Little slow tonight.
Yeah, come on in.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Frankie.
Suit yourself.
Just the same.
We have some lotion.
Maybe next time.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Swimming trunks.
Trunks?
Frank.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Honey ...
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Honey ...
You bring trunks, Jack?
Well, look at this.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
What do you do to him?
No bones.
No bones?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
How will he eat?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
How many?
They gotta go.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
They're falling out.
What's wrong with them?
Teeth.
What's our friend's problem?
Baker.
Beasley.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Go fuck yourself.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Get your hand off me.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
Accident?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
What's wrong with the kid?
Oh.
My brother and I. One each.
Two at a time?
Piano.
Oh.  What do you do?
No.
You the magician?
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
Oh no!
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Recognize these two characters?
Oh my God ...
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
Twenty years, Ma ...
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
How's the birthday girl?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
My pleasure.
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Two nights.
What's the gig?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
When they coming in?
Out.
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
She asked for it.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Five years ago.  November.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Yeah?
Charlie called.
I can keep the beat.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
How're your hands?
This'll kill 'em.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Good choice.
I'll take the Mallory.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
No.
Go ahead.
Sure.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Yeah, fine.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Right.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Later.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
What're you doing?
I didn't hear you come in.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Jack!
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Fuck you.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
You weren't there.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Stay off it.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
What?
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Shut up, Frank.
Jack, you're on television.
What?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
What?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Seventy-one
What channels it on?
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
You don't know?
I don't know.
What disease?
I don't know. Some disease.
What's it for?
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Nothing. We get nothing.
No.
We're not getting paid then.
Twenty-eight years.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
Better give her pneumonia.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Cancel, Frank.
Just until we find another girl.
What're you doing?
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Be reasonable, Jack.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
What do you mean?
I can't make the tenth.
What?
The tenth's out.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
You're making things up, Frank.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
You could've come.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
He was just having fun.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
You always threw up.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
They were simple songs.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
A useless talent.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
April.
February?
Couple years.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
The Royal.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Expensive hangover.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
The party's over.
Celebrating.  Join me?
What're you doing down here?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
How come I didn't hear anything?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
He was wearing a suit.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
What are you talking about?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
Huh?
You saw wrong.
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
What?
Funny, huh?
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
What the hell are these?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
She's a big girl.
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
No. Why?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Time flies, huh?
Two hours ago!
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
How long you been at it?
Fine.
How's it coming?
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Really.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
What the hell are you doing?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
How dare you say you love me.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
What's the matter with you?
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
What?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
Because I can hear it.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Doesn't it matter to you?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Christ, can't you hear it?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Why would I mind?
Yeah.  You mind?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Yeah.
We're gonna be here a week?
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
You leaving that on?
Right.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Good idea.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Okay.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
No, you take the right.
Unless you want the right.
Right.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Okay.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
He's drunk.
A few bars!
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
I thought we had separate rooms.
Sunday.
Last?
Day.  Wednesday.
First night?
November.  '71.
Two years ago.  March.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Very realistic.
So what do you think?
Just a lucky guess.
You recognized me.
Hey, Frank.
Right.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Yeah, fine.
You all right?
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Yeah.  Something.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
I'll take my chances.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Make it collect.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Oh, brother.
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
How about these?
See anything?
Here, how's this?
No.
She's here.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
You hit me.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
It's not gonna hurt you.
Get out of here!
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Awe inspiring.
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
She'll get here.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
It's early.
Where the hell is she?
Okay?
I'll drop the eighths.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
I didn't get her number.
What's the matter?
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
What are you, crazy?
All right.  What's your name?
Let's get it over with.
Jack.
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
What?
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
It never was.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
What's that?
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I'm not unhappy.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
That's what we agreed.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
Sure, why not.
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
Talk.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
A gust of wind killed him.
That how you see it?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
What was it like?
No.
No?
It wasn't like that.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
The hell you don't.
I don't know what you mean.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Terrific.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
What?
Nice, huh?
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Jack.
Yeah, okay.
So you'll come out, right?
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
What're you talking about?
We don't get a gig.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
It's not family.  It's business.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Frank?
It's me.
Yeah?
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
What's with Charlie?
Her hands.  Like that.
What do you mean?
I made her nervous.
You'll see.
So what'd we get her?
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Your older brother.
Says who?
You gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
This time you gotta go.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
We gotta go, Jack.
So do I.
No, I mean it.
No thanks.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
It's more than that.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
Why the interest?
Seeing anyone in particular?
Only on odd days.
Really.  You sleeping?
Thanks.
You look awful.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
Try the black Knable.
What do you think?
Yamaha white.  Nice.
What d'ya got?
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
Bosen black.  Flat.
What d'ya got?,
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
You got weird kids, Frank.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Cindy.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
It was an accident.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
You're their uncle.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
So we on tomorrow night?
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Jack...
Count it.
Huh?
Count it.
Like an angel.
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Don't make trouble, all right?
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Lotta water.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
What's wrong with it?
Christ, will you look at your hair?
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Jack.
Frank.
Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
What's the point?
That's not the point.
Am I late?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
How we doing?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
All right.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
All right.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Just call me a cab.
You sure?
No, we're not.  Jack?
No, no.  You boys are tired.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
The audience was a little off tonight.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
So what'd you think?
Spur of the moment.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Doctor's orders.
So she's got a few sniffles.
The flu.
Sick?  How sick?
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
Yes, it is.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Uh... he knows it.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Right.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Well, that's fine --
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Blanche.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
I'm sorry?
Actually, that's my stage name.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
You find a girl?
Miss --
So run a little longer.
We ran long.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
You're an hour and a half late.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
Impersonally.
How should I take it?
Don't take it personally.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
This is show business?
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
My watch is broken, too.
You're an hour and a half late.
What about me?
We're finished.
What do you mean?
This is where the auditions were.
This where the auditions are?
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
What?
I can't sing it anymore.
Forget it.
Huh?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Forget it.
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Some discussion.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Uh ...
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Huh?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
What's with you guys?
Well then ... shall we?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Got another song for us?
Huh?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
What's with you two?
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Oh yeah?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
They must've bought the same map we did.
Hey, will you look at that?
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
Wow. You ever see her again?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
What'd she sing?
Tell her.
Peggy Lee?
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
You're kidding me.
Yeah.
Great?
Great.
Hey, we're connected.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Smells like fish.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
I don't believe it.
Jack?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Go ahead.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
He's right.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Virgins?
Virgins.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Baker's unabridged.
You play all these places?
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You two could play checkers.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Maybe it's legit.
Hey.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Jack, you with us?
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Hey!
Give me that.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Fucking.
Did you hear it?
I said I was sorry.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Piece of cake.
Right.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
You're a prince.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Oh, thanks.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
They're nines.
They're tight.
Right.
Shoes?
Zip me up?
Uh... good.
What do you think?
Big feet.
Nine!
Nine?
Nine.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
Save it for your wife.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
I wear a seven.
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
A seven.
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Time for what?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Hey!
Come on.
Am I missing something?
It's orange!
What's wrong with it?
That!  You can't wear that!
Do I look like I'm naked?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
What's he talking about?
Where's your dress?
Changed?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
What-?
Where's my name?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
We're a team.  We work together.
What I mean is --
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
What's the problem?
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Ready?
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
When we know.
When?
Uh ... we'll let you know.
So?
That's the premise.
I sing now?
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Uh, well ...
Is that important?
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Yes, well, they are.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Born and bred.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
I'll call you.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
I'll call you.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Uh ... thanks.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Thanks.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Brought it.
Will I see you again?
Funny job.
Funny hours.
Job.
How come?
Gotta go.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Right.  In there.
Baker.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
He doesn't bite.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Come on, Ed.
Right.  Bring him back.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Don't worry about it.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
No.
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
Black.  Labrador.
Save it.  What's he look like?
The name's Baker --
All right.  Hold on.
Yeah.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
Regular hours are eight to five.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
It's been a long time, Ma.
You miss him, don't you?
I suppose.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
For a while.  She left.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Pretty much.
Is that the way it is?
He leads, I follow.
And you don't?
Frank works hard.
It went well tonight.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
No.
Downstairs.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Yeah.
I didn't want to wake you.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
No.
Let me get the light.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Hi.
Jack.
If I see him.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
I've given it up.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Vegetables.
Huh?
What kind?
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
So how's the cat food business?
Yeah.
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
We outgrew each other.
So ... ?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
There's always another girl.
You can always get another girl.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Look, if you want to leave...
Yeah... No.
Coffee?
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Frank said ---
Oh.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
So, what happened?
He had a mind that escalated things.
You're kidding.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Nervous?
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
You sending me home?
Long story.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
He called her.
The both of them?  In there?
No kidding?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Huh?
History.
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
Soap?
Soap convention.
Must've been a cheap date.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Sure.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Ed? How many people live here?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Friend.
Who's Nina?
Nina?
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
How do you know?
You were good.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Look. You don't know good. All right?
All I said was you were good.
I'm not upset.
You're upset.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
What's the matter?
Better than that.
I can keep the beat.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
How do you do it? Every night?
It's a shitty  song.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Just dinner and dance, right?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Hey, business is business.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
In and out.
Like a baby. You?
How's egghead?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
In and out.
Can't sleep?
It's okay.  Last one.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
I guess in case one year they're not.
So why's he do it?
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
He do that every year?
Nothing personal --
Forget it.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Forget it.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
You want me to walk you?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
Huh?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
The Stratford.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
He takes after our mother.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
His kid's sick.
Where's egghead?
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Fucking.
Not for money. With my mother.
You never sang before?
He'll come around.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
He's got blood in his eye.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Another five years, huh?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Losing his teeth.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
Sure.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Yeah?
Jack.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
From Hurley's?
Not so good.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
How'd the show go?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Ever go to church?
What's a prom?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Why not?
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Wow.
Older than me.
Looks old.
Ivory.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I guess it's getting serious.
Oh?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
How do you know?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
The recent past.
What are they?
My days are not the old days, genius.
Is that what you used to do?
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Married.
What happened to the donut king?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Guess they're up.
Eddie did.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
He's losing his teeth.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Eddie.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
I'm not much for sweets.
None?
Huh? Oh, no.
Big piece or little?
Oh, fine.
Fine.  You?
So. How are you?
Good to see you, Ma.
John.  It's good to see you.
