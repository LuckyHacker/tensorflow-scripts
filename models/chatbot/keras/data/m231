I mean... feelings.
What do you mean?
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Nothing.
Sure.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
I'm just talking, man.
You don't have to tell me this.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
Don't talk like that.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
I'm not a monster.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
Isn't it?
It's not what you think.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
C'mon, Walter.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
Early July.
Next week? The week after?
Soon.
When?
Aren't you glad?
Annette will see you.
What's that?
I've got some good news.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
Ah, come on.
No thanks.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
The birthday party.
What party?
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Fucking Mariners.
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
What's happening?
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
Then what? What?!
It wasn't like that.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
You need a table.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
It was a beautiful present.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Yeah. It's really nice.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
It's a nice table.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
Huh?
Cherry.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
What are you doing?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
How old is Anna?
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Is it because of Anna?
I'm working on it.
When can I see her?
Annette? She's good... tense.
How is she?
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
What?
One hundred and twenty feet.
I like the noise.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Something wrong with that?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
K through sixth.
Hey, is that a school?
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
Beautiful. How's business?
Five years.
No shit.
Foreman now.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
You doing okay?
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Robin.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
What does that mean?
Well... not in the common way.
I'm not pretty.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I have friends.
Don't you have friends?
It's my bird book.
What are you writing in that book?
Not yet.
See anything interesting?
It's good to listen to your daddy.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Do you come here often?
I have to go.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Were you watching me?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
You live around here?
You should hear the bird.
That was terrific.
Something like that.
It's a bright sound.
I'd love to hear it.
I bet you can.
I can't.
Try.
It's hard to describe.
How does it sound?
Their sound is quite musical.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
It's just a city park.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
You always carry these?
The mother sure has her hands full.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
Why not?
I don't like starlings.
Is that right?
They're starlings.
Sure.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
In that birch tree is a nest.
There's a million birds here.
Birds.
What are you looking at?
'Fraid not.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
I count my blessings.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
Yes.
The passionate one?
It's a free country, isn't it?
I'd say you're moving.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
What's with the boxes?
I have a passionate girlfriend.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
I could take you downtown.
I wasn't feeling well.
I went to bed around seven.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
I was asleep.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
No.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
Know what?
You don't know?
The girl.
What?
You knew her?
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
Little Red Riding Hood.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I don't know.
The one with the ax?
Woodsman?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
No.
Do you believe in them?
Fairy tales?
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
Yes.
You walked home.
I fell asleep.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
They grow outside, don't they?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
What?
Too much sun.
Okay.
Okay?
Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
You can't talk to me like --
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Who said I wanted to buy it?
It's not for sale.
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
Yeah.
Cherry?
If you could, you would have brought one today.
I could get a search warrant.
Doesn't everybody?
Got something to hide?
I would.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I haven't broken any laws.
Why don't you just tell me?
I think you do.
I have no idea.
You don't know?
Have a seat.
What's up?
Cop.
Hiya, Walter.
You are in.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
Yeah.
But you are taking it?
It gives me headaches.
Are you taking your medication?
Apartment's okay.
And your new apartment?
I'm adjusting okay.
So. How are you adjusting?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
People have the right to know.
Lovers' quarrel?
Have you seen Walter?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Just trying to be helpful.
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Why's that?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
What?
I'd keep away from him.
Will I see you again?
It's getting dark. Go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
You should go home.
I don't mind.
No.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
Yes?
Walter?
Robin, listen to me.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
I know because... it's just something I know.
How do you know?
Your daddy will always love you.
But will he... ?
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
What will happen if I do?
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
Yes you can, Robin.
I can't.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
Ms. Kramer.
What's her name?
Do you like it when he asks you?
Yes.
Does he?
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
They sound like finches.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Are you sure?
No thank you.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
What?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Yes?
Robin?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Banished... yeah.
It sounds like you were banished.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
How come?
No.
Do you have many friends?
Walter.
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
No you're not.
I'm twelve.
Can I ask how old you are?
Yeah, like the bird.
I feel... okay.
How do you feel about that?
Time.
It's going to take time, Walter.
Accept you?
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
It was a small house.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
I meant later... when you two took naps.
I was six years old!
Did you get an erection?
Yes.
You felt pleasure.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
What else?
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
I'm only asking questions.
This is garbage!
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
Nothing.
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
All right.
Don't ever do that again.
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
What the hell are you doing there?
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
A nap?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
And what are you doing?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
But roughly, how old?
We're little kids.
How old are you and your sister?
In my bed too.
Where are you?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Where?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Sorry.  Where is she?
Not so fast.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
I see my sister.
Who do you see?
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
I don't see --
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
No, I am not going to --
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
I'm relaxed.
To relax.
Why?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
What?
Close your eyes.
That's my answer.
That's not a helpful answer.
I don't know.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
You mean my problem?
When did it all start?
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
I said I was sorry.
Please don't do it again.
Sorry.
You're very late.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
Go home, Walter.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
I want to talk about it now.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I want you to calm down.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Is this the first one?
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
I don't know!
What did you want to happen?
I don't know.
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
You don't know!
I know --
Fuck you, Rosen!
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I want to be normal!
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
What is your idea of being a Jew?
What is your idea of being normal?
How do they know?
They usually tell me.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
I don't.
How do you define it?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I'm afraid not.
You couldn't say.
I couldn't say.
Will I ever be normal?
We have a lot of work to do.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a few more minutes.
How long is this going to take?
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
Is that what you are angry about?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Why do you think you're here?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Do you think you're crazy?
I'm not that crazy.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
What are you afraid will happen?
Have to talk about something.
Then why are you talking about this?
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
You have no feelings for your niece?
I don't feel anything.
How do you feel about that?
I don't need someone else.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Forget it.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Honest? No.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
It's okay.
You don't like coming here, do you?
I wish you'd give it a try.
I'm still thinking about it.
How's the journal?
Then think about it.
No fucking way.
Try it.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
How's that?
It's very good, indeed.
You think reflection is good.
That's right.
Reflect.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Bad idea.
It was just an idea.
Of course.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Ev-i-dence.
I don't understand.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Why not?
No way.
That's right.
A diary?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
What?
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
It's all the same.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
That was a joke.
You seem a little hostile today.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I said the job is okay.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
The job's okay.
And how's your job?
Not when they fly.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Fucking liar.
Yeah.
You okay?
I need a shower.
Do you want to talk about it?
I didn't sleep well.
Nothing.
What's going on?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
What's your fucking problem?
Sneak up behind me like that.
Do what?
Don't do that.
Prove it.
I'm not scared.
Don't be scared, Walter.
You're such an asshole.
Thank you.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
I don't need a plant.
What's it look like?
What's this?
Fine.
I say we call it quits.
That's not what I meant.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Who doesn't?
I've got problems.
Just think about it.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
It's a bad idea.
Move in with me.
Live together.
We should live together.
Maybe you should be.
Neither am I.
I'm not scared.
You're scared.
Us seeing each other.
What?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Not ever.
Not ever?
Are you serious?
You never asked them about it?
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
No you don't.
I love my brothers.
You must hate your brothers.
All three -- in chronological order.
Which brother did this?
I got poked around... here and there.
Why not tell me now?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
The percentages --
What odds?
Most people say the odds are against me.
I know.
Being here, with me.
What?
You know, this is crazy.
Bullshit.
Nothing. It's over.
And what do you tell yourself now?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
You really believe that?
I was always the one seduced.
They seduce you?
Their power. They seduce me.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Why young girls, Walter?
I've changed.
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
Sounds like a special guy.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
I'm sorry, Walter.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
You mean the time you're locked away?
Yes! I want to know.
You don't really --
What was prison like?
No. Never again.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
Walter.
Depraved? My mistake.
Hey, I'm not --
Get your kicks somewhere else.
What?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
Twelve years in prison?
I never hurt them. Never.
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
How young?
It's not what you think.
What did you do to them?
Sorry.
How many girls did you molest?
Look, you can go now.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
You're not joking.
Yeah.
Molested little girls?
I molested little girls.
So, what did you do?
Yeah.
The worst?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Because I like you.
Why do you want to know?
Hi.
Hey, there.
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Is that all?
I suffer from insomnia.
Did I say something wrong?
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
What for?
I thought I'd stay the night.
The morning?
How about in the morning.
Maybe later.
Tell me about it.
Since you've had sex?
It's been a while since...
Do you?
You think I have a problem?
What's the problem?
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
No you're not.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
You're still here.
Hey, that was... intense.
Not tonight.
So, you're not a dyke.
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
What?
So?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Why do you want to know?
So... what's your dark secret?
I get that impression.
I'm not easily shocked.
Yeah?
Something happened to you.
You're damaged.
What?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Yeah, they could.
They could eat you.
What about them?
What about bears?
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
You must hate it.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I like the noise.
Doesn't it get noisy?
K through sixth.
Is that a school?
Sorry.
You plan to drink both those beers?
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
I'll buy a plant.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
What?
Southern light.
What do you think?
Are you?
I thought you were a dyke.
You never spoke to me before.
They're all assholes.
Neither do you.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
I'm just quiet.
You're quiet at work.
Guess I'm not like most women.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
What's weird about that?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Very weird.
People without cars.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Yeah, you.
Me?
I'm talking about you.
What picture?
There's something wrong with this picture.
It's fucking freezing out here.
I'm all right.
Want a ride?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
Are you okay?
What?
