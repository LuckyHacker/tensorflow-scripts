I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
I'm going to Paris.
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
We don't know what we're into!
What do you want to do?
Forget it.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- he went inside! --
This doesn't go upstairs.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
No.  We can't risk it.
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
I'm not asking.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I want a second opinion.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
And what if I couldn't do that?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
I thought you were never going to do that.
Yes.
You're asking me a direct question?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
I don't know what we're talking about.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Why?
...they won't let you go...
What do they want me to do?
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
I think so.
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
What is Treadstone?
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
Treadstone.
...it's a problem...
Yes.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Paris.  I live in Paris...
...which one are you?...
Treadstone?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
What do you mean?
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
I won't ask again.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Keep it. 
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Jason Bourne is dead.
We have to go home, Jason.
I don't think so.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
That's all I get?
So it's time to go home.
So now you know.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I don't know.
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
Are you Treadstone?
Get the kids out!
I don't know.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Who do you think sent me?
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
MPG Capital.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Yeah, I know...
Sir, you waited on line.
Look, maybe I should just...
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
You have your passport?
Right.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
You're a U.S. Citizen?
One moment, sir.
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
-- sir? --
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Paris?

...yes -- oui -- uh...
I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
His brother.  You know his brother?
Who?  Who came?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
...I understand...
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Yes.
You are a friend of his?
Yes.  Is he there?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes, I'm here...
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
That'd be great.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I hadn't heard.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
Excuse me?
Was it the break-in?
Okay.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Yes.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
Did you?
We thought you were gone for good.
Really.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Thanks.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Not really.
You have ID?
Think I could rent a scooter?
Yes.
This your store?
Can I help you?
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
What about you?
I can't protect you anymore.
What was I thinking, right?
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
And that's it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What?
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx.
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
You could do that?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
Go back to the hotel.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
I don't know. 
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
What is that?
Nykwana Wombosi. 
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
It's a company... MPG Capital.
Who paid the bill?
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
-- we'll tell them what happened --
-- forget it --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- how? --
-- we'll explain it --
-- there's no time --
But the police --
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
Oh, Jesus...
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
I didn't know this would happen.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I trusted you.
No.
You knew he was coming.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
He came to kill us.
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He's dead isn't he?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- just --
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...omigod, no...
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
Go ahead.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
I guess so.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Anytime.
Thanks for the ride.
Okay, so...
Jason...
I don't remember any of this.
I should go.
I guess.
So this is it, right?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Where?
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
Looks familiar?
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
That's it?  Is that it?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
I thought about it.  I don't know.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
I can't believe I slept.
We're about an hour away.
Where are we?
I needed a break.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
People do amazing things when they're scared.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Okay, so you're a victim.
I was shot twice in the back.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
-- you could put it together --
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
No.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?

That's what I'm saying.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
What?  Like amnesia?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Listen to what you want.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I know that.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
Then I'll find another ride.
What if I say no?
I won't hurt you.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
You have blood on your pants.
I said ten thousand.
For twenty thousand dollars.
I want to go home.
So what's in Paris?
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
Jesus...
You don't want the police any more than I do.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Get the fuck away from my car.
I've got a situation here and --
It's a little late for that.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Oh, Jesus... 
I need a ride out of here.

I need a ride.
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
So get the hell out of here.
Shit, we didn't sign in.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Where did this body go?
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute --
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
What the hell're you talking about?
Get everyone down in the basement.
What?
Get in the basement.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
He run away often?
My husband's out looking for him.
Where's the dog?

xxxxxx...
So now you're asking for a student visa?
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
-- I'm on it --
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
Enhance it.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What's that?
Sir...
Hang on... 
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
That's the only angle.
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
That'll solve all our problems.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
What?
All of them?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What the fuck is he doing?
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
What?
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- he accessed the account --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
I tried.
Tell him we're busy.
Abbott wants to talk.
What?
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- what're you talking about? --
I won't forget this.
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
I don't know.
You drink rum?
I don't remember Zurich.
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
No.
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
I told you.  You need to rest.
What if it doesn't come back?
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
How did I get here?
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
<u>Where am I</u>?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Where am I?
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
