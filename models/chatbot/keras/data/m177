Nothing.  Just...memories!
What?
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...
What's cookin', Bert?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
Time to check with Flavors.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Fools!
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
A wreck.
How's Brad?
Of course.
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
You bet, Bert.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
Infantile regression.
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
About Brad's family?
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
SIN-I-FUL
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
But...how?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
When do I get to see Brad?
Home?
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
I've caught it once or twice.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I know, I know, it's just...
He needs help.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Introduce yourselves.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
So it seems.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Why Janet?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
How did you come by this scenario?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Who trusts experts?
We're the experts.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
SOLD??!!
Dentonvale has been sold.
SPONSOR!!!
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
He was a President.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
In a little masquerade?
Indulge?
Care to indulge?
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Are you spoken for this evening?
Yes, Betty.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Now Betty, don't overreact.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
...closed?
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
McKinley?...McKinley?
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Everything's free there.
A free thinker.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
In a way...
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
You too, Betty!
Shove it, Ralph!
I'll leave you young things to it.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
But I don't need treadment.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
I'm not going, Janet.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
I don't want to get up there.
That's us.

Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
I'd forgotten.
He was adopted you know.
Mental instability?
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Absolutely correct.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Sure thing.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Who?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
What do you mean?
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
That doesn't make sense.
But they only think they're happy.
Of course.
Could I do that later?
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
You're practically naked!
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Why?
You shouldn't have said that.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Poor Brad.
What show?
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
It's...
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
I know.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?

OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
BRAD!
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Brad!
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
. . .For his own good.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Do you really think so?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
I want to see Brad.
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
Me?
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I'm...happy.
No...couldn't I do this later?
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
No!  He's never done that before.

YOU'RE NO GOOD
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
That's an extremely negative response.
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
What does he know about it?
Our field.
I don't think he intends to go that far.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Our speciality.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Surely.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
We love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Isn't she lovely?
We're not confused.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
No.
And none of them worked?
