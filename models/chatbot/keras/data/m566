Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
A beauty. Who is she?
Yes.
Someone you know?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Who wants me to stop?
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
He's still a doctor.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'm going to get a doctor.
Oh, yes. I remember.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
When's your baby due?
Dead.
And how's Yurek?
Just over a year.
How long have you been married?
He'll be here soon.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
He'll be back before curfew.
I need help.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Sit.
Come in! come in!
Dorota.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I'll see you...soon.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
How are you doing?
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Dorota!
Wladek, please.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
No one plays Chopin like you.
Wladek, please.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Really?
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
It's nothing.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Who are you?
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Hello.
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
For what? For my tie?
How will we sleep?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
Let me see this.
Let's find out.
Will I still be able to play?
What are you doing?
What did I tell you?
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
What's happened?
I'm on the run!
What's happened?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Here.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
I'll be fine.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Thanks.
wish I knew you better.
What?
Funny time to say this.
What?
Halina?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Calm down, what, what is it?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
Have you seen this?
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Who told you?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
I've no money.
It costs.
Can you help us?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help?
Tough luck.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
I haven't seen him.
Henryk's in there.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
Yes, please.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Who's recruiting?
We're recruiting.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Boys, boys...
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
What's this about?
Do they?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
And suppose they take the table away?
Yes, that's why I brought it.
Very appropriate.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
What are you reading?
You'll be deported.
Otherwise what?
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Hungry.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
That's also my business.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
They were taking you away.
I can look after myself!
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
What did you pay him?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
You're out, aren't you?
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
It's not funny.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
I know.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
That's better than yesterday.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You sell anything?
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
Just shut up.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
We use what?
You know what we do? We use psychology.
That makes a change.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
It certainly was.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
Yes, but what good did it do?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Yes, so did the Germans.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
Can you help? I've no money...
I'm not, but Majorek is.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Why didn't you come to me?
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Not this week.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Toilets?
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
There are always notices going up.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
But I want to help, I want to.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
So, what's the news?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Wladek! How are you?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Takes one to know one! Pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Dirty pig!
Bitch!
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
You made contact?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
If you need help...
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
How long have you been here?
Stop it, Wladek.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
God forbid!
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I'm not going anywhere.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Out of Warsaw.
Where are we going?
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
I've been worried sick.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
No, I don't think so?
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Szpilman.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
What about you?
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
I don't know how to thank you.
Not yet.
Are the Russians here?
We're getting out.
What's happening?
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
What's all that gunfire?
Show me.
In the attic.
Where are you hiding?
A pianist.
I am... I was a pianist.
What's your work?
Where do you live?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
What the hell are you doing?
