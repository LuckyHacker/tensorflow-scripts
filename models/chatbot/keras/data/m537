You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Mm-hm.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yeah.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
How long were you in there?
Intense.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
In Group?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Yeah.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Knock yourself out.
Can I have some?
I don't anymore.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Um-hm.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Mn-hm.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
We are?
I don't know.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Uh, home, you know.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Typical male.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Yes.
Responsibility, progress.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Uh-huh.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Slides go with it.
What did you guys think?
Yeah!
Was it okay?
That was really great.
Okay, whatever you want.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Now?
Do you wanna go to the van?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Yeah.
Right now?
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Sounds like a bummer.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Any gunshot victims?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Your a nurse?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Oh.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
A cloud?
A cloud.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
It's really not about anything.
What's it about?
Yup.
Hey, you said you did a video?
No I quit.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Hey!
Yeah, when's he coming?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
No.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Guess not.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Yeah, man.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
No, no, no.
Bullshit.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Tim...
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
She's dead?
She's dead.
What?
Buff...
What she doin' in the van, man?
She's in the van.
Hey, man.
Look.
What?
Erica is in the van back there.
Wait. Hey, man.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Y- s-sure it did.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
What, they're looking for her?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
You know?
I know, man.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
No.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, no.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Uh, last night...
Yeah.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Hey, you know me.
No, I mean, no one.
Sure.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Good.
No, I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No.
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
No, no.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
In the limo!!!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Fuck it!
So you can do an album cover?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
Go!
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Okay.
A long, long, long...
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Watch out for that tree.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Ah!
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
That sounds so depressing.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
I'd get bored.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
No, he's not with a girl.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Jesus Christ.
Sorry.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
No, no.
That's the rock star thing.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
The dude wants it.
Don't let 'em fight.
Yes!
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
Yeah.
It's your birthday?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
What?
Stuck with what guy?
Shut up! Aw...
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Where are you-hoo?
No, I'm here. Where are you?
And your mom.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Really?
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Play it! Come on!
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Jeff! Let's go!
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Ah, you know people there?
Hey.
Hey, man.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Really?
Great.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Come on man.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
I will.
You better! Yes!
I can come visit?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Yeah?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I'm so burnt-out.
Hey! Hey.
Alright, Pony!
Yes! Free concert!
Buff is funny. God.
Buff.
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
In what way?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Shit.
Am I fucking him?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Mm. And your like, what else?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Your his publicist?
Yeah.
Oh, you were in the band?
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Good. See you later.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Glad it's okay.
It's okay.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
It's safe, come on.
Please!
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
This is private property, my friend.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
He paid you man.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Score! Yeah!
I'll be in the car, okay?
Thanks, man!
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
You okay, man? You okay?
A reel?
Yeah!
Yes!
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I could.
You could do it.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You make videos?
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
Thanks. See man?
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Hey, thanks, man.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
No, no, whoa!
Whoa!
Don't drop the guitar, man.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
I just started it.
Please.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Well, play it, man.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Yeah, we're all above that.
Oh, So what about her?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
No, but I heard it was great.
Oh, you were there?
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Come on. Inside.
Okay.
Will you stand up for me?
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
What's up guys?
I'm sorry.
Taking care of business.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Yeah?
I know. It's okay.
I'm not a nice guy.
That's what I mean.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's a mistake to think that.
Deep down. Way down.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Erica.
What was your name again?
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Let's see.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
You cut off your little finger?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Mm.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Really?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Mm-mm.
Oh, yeah?
I'd like to.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Military marching bands.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
What about me? I don't have a car.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Mm.
A Porsche.
What'd he get you?
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
He is.
He is.
Yes.
He is?
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
No, not really. Middle-class.
You rich?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
It's nice here. It's different.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Mm-mm.
Erica, you coming?
Thank you.
It's coming along.
It does look good.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
Pony and I are friends.
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Hi.
Funny shit, man.
I'd love to read that.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Mm.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
We were?
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Oh, wow.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, sure.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Uh-huh.
He's drunk.
Can you tell me what happened?
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Two-fifty.
Come on!
Is that Bee-Bee?
Jeff! Come up here!
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
That, that's Indian?
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Jeff, stay there.
Just put it down.
No.
Will you just put the gun down?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
This is my home.
Just go home, alright?
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
No.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
No.
You don't know?
I don't know.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh, shit.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Yes.
Wow. You did that for me?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
You lied to me.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
They let you out?
Oh fuck.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
I hit her.
What'd you do?
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Well, w-what happened?
That chick, Erica?
What? What'd you do?
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
What?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
No.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Good. That's good.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
See ya later.
Ask your girlfriend.
Tim, what are you talking about?
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
Sooze wants to see him.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
Nobody. Sooze.
Who were you talking to?
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Because I'm alienated.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Look, look, just get off my property.
Please?
Nazeer Chaudry!
Nazeer what?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Look, why do you care, huh?
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
That's right.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
I don't know.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Look, your trespassing.
Why we're just standing here.
I gave it to you.
Seven-twenty.
What?
Just go.
You really suck, you know that?
Just go.
What?
Go.
'Bye, Jeff.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Oh, fuck it, man!
You did, huh? Good for you.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You're unbelievable.
Oh, no, no, no.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Well, what about us?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I've run out of words.
Shit, Jeff!
To his hotel?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Wait, away?
For a ride.
Where are you going?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
Is that a threat?
No, no, I have to talk to you.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
Mm.
I, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Mm-hm.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
What?
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No. No, no, no.
Come on.
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
Jeff!
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Mm.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
I don't know.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, no.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Mm-mm.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
My goal is to make art.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Mm-hm.
New ground?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Nothing.
So what do you wanna do?
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Come with me.
And?
Of course.
Us.
What feelings?
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
What?
Sooze.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Jeff. Jeff.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
How?
I would've stopped it.
Okay, what would you have done.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
It got that close.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
It was a racial incident.
Tim!
This is ridiculous!
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Typical male.
Can I talk?
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
What? What do you stand for?
Yes, I stand for -
But do you stand for anything?
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
I'm talking about idealism.
Hey!
Your completely missing the point.
One!
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Name one.
Of course I do!
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Like what?
About things that are important to me.
About what?
Yes, you asshole.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
So you can give me more shit?
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Your sure as hell right about that.
It's a piece.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Man?
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Yes.
No.
Was that supposed to be me?
Okay, so maybe later.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
I hate that.
Oh! Trim it!
I know, I know, I know.
You could've come over.
God, I haven't seen you all day.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey, where's Erica?
Burnfield. No place like it.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Oh, yeah.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
You know what I'm saying?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Of course it does.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
What?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
What do you mean?
So who are you?
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
For a while.
Well, not exactly.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Great.
Yeah.
Now?
Yeah, really.
Really?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Like songs?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
What?
So you think I should?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
So how's college?
Sorry.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
The prom. That's funny.
Yeah, good.
Yeah, I crash there.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Yeah.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
No, it's not...
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Good, man.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Hey, Pony.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
No, this has everything to do with you.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
I hope you're happy!
What are you saying?
Ready?
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Get off my roof!
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look Pakeesa...
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Get off my property!
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Look, get down off my property.
Please. Look...
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Camel jockey.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Well, what about this?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Nobody's fucking anybody!
What the fuck are you talking about?!
I think I gotta go.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Really? What else does your mother say?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Yeah?
You know, my mom has this saying.
Oh, my god!
Is that Jeff?
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
You do?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Me?
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
That's because I am.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yep.
Soon.
Mm-hm.
No, I'm going.
If...
I'm moving.
I can't believe you're still here.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
You done?
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
Jesus, Jeff.
Mine too.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
That was so great!
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
Alright!
Alright, alright already.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Yeah, come on, play it.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
Yeah.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Would I get paid?
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I'm always serious.
You're not serious.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
Yeah?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Hey.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
You do not!
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
New York, huh?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Like?
Yeah.
Yeah?
It's pretty exciting.
So? What's L.A. like?
Oh, yeah?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Oh!
Look at you!
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
It's stupid.
Is that your driver?
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Hey!
Pony, oh my god!
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Your manager?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah?
If you hit me...
What are you going to do? Hm?
Don't do that.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
Yeah.
It's none of my business?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Don't do that, man, okay?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Whatever.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
About what?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Oh, How'd she get back?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Tim?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Where do you get your ideas?
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
I'm here.
So where are you?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah.
Just one?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Could you give me a ride?
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Oh that's nice for you.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Jeff!
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Come on, Jeff.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Hey, Tim.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Seriously? It's a great idea.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Fuck.
You know the fuck not.
The fuck not?
No car.
I'm going out later.
