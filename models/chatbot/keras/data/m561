... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Did you tell him?
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Of course.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
You're leaving?
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
But your man isn't quite a God!
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
No.
Does he know?
Yes.
Are you going to keep it?
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
You're going to live here permanently?
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
He seems to have won it.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
The Italian, I presume?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
You're right.  You're fired.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Good afternoon.
Italian is practically the same thing.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
It can't be true!
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
No!
The documents are forged.
What's happened??
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
What d'you mean?
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
... So am I.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Did the driver really freeze?
I said that the file is incomplete.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Johana, am I boring you?
What kind?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Is he alright?  What happened?
That idiot!
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Why?
Don't.
... Not yet.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
How do you know that?
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
He can learn.  He is learning.
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
I won't, I swear.
Because you'd laugh.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
You risk your life when you cross the street.
You know what I'm talking about.
What else is there?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
Checking out the competition.
What are you doing here?
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Enzo!
Jacques!  Johana!
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
Is it a poem?
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
The Mamma's there too.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
... It's a comfortable place.
Yes...
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Well, good night, then...
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Congratulations, Enzo.
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Okay.
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
No.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
Italy!
And just where are you from?
Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
What was he like, when he was little?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Have you known him long?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
You forgot the Hula!
I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
No.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
Congratulations.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
In a lake.
Where did you two meet?
I think I'll have a coffee.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
This is a great pleasure.
Enzo Molinari.
Yes.
You know each other?
Hello!
I tell you she's mine!
What does that mean?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Dollars.
Lira?
Ten thousand.
How many are, down there?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
How did it happen?
He's training.
Is he here?
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
Where did you get that?
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Enzo, wake up!
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
What about the shoes?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
Yes?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Then tell him to wax it too.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Have the car painted.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Six seconds.
Roberto?  How long?
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Try speaking to me?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
And... does the voice come back?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
What's with the voice?
I didn't say...  Brussels!
And where did you say you were from?
Noireuter.
... What's your name again?
The rules are the rules.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
It isn't lit yet.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
I can't.
... Push me back in the water...
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
... I was right about what?
You were right.
Well that's very nice of you.
No!  I would never cheat you.
You say that because you have the title!
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
I'm concentrating.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
... How long was I asleep?
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
That's good.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Thank you.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
... Yes.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
I don't want to erase anything.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
He doesn't like us.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Can I come in?
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
You don't have that one, do you?
Yes.
You still collect them?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
What is it?
Here...  Here...
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
What?
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
Good night.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
... I'm listening.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Two years younger than you.
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Why?
Well... about everything.
Everything about what?
... Everything.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
... For the mermaids.
Why?
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
No.
Get in the car!
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
... And his friend, Johana...
Madame...
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Your mother?
What?
Enzo?
You're staying at the hotel?
Not at all!
No, no!
Forget it.  I was joking.
People say that?
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
No.
... You married?
It's okay.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
That's good.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Well, what are they?
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
I don't have one.
What room have you got?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
You're the best, Enzo!
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Why?
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Great!
I dove 315 feet!
Yes, I know.
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Enzo...
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
No...
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Fine!
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
Who?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Tea... or whiskey?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
A drink to warm up?
Does anybody live to make a second?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Don't you have a heater?
Promise you won't forget me.
Anything.
Promise me one thing.
You are the father.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
I saw how it has to be.
You've got to tell me what happened?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Why?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
You want to lie down for a while?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
What's wrong?
You go back, I'll walk.
Jacques...?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
What are you doing?
... Nothing.
What?
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
You'll try again tomorrow?
I didn't dive.
And you?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
You'll understand.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
Absolutely positive.
You sure?
... Not at all.
I'm being a pain, huh?
It's me again.
Hello?
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
No... tell me.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
Uh... Ah!  A story?
Then, tell me a story.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
I'm still here.
So have I.  ... Hello?
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
I got fired.
How are you?
It's me... Johana.
Hello?
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Why?
I'm going back home.
Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
I did?
Jacques, you set a world record.
Uh... Yes, of course!
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
I don't know, I just feel it.
How do you know that?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
... The way she moves.
How can you tell it's a female?
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
... No?
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
I'd better get back now.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Give it to me.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
My wallet.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
You jumped in?
Lucky I was there to save you.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
... Especially the sneakers.
Thank you...
You look adorable.
It's too loud for me.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
I don't know... why?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
... Okay.  I'll try.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
But what brought you to Sicily?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Please, have a seat.
No... in the hut.
In the lake?
We saw each other a little while ago.
I recognize you.
Ah?!
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Positive, Sir.
... Are you sure?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
Louis, we were French!
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
It's my apartment.
In my apartment?
Well... here.
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Uncle Louis!
He doesn't hear too well.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Johana... New York.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Assassin!
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
What?
Why don't you ask me?
No.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
No.  I'm just depressed.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Way past it.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Haven't you been listening?
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
It's his heartbeat.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
How was your trip?
What?
Well?
They're going to send detectives.
You called the police?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
... And the new stereo.
They got the new T.V.
Again?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... Sally?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
Yes... It's magic.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
... And those?
Of course, that's what they're for.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
What are they for?
Let him sleep.
I'll go see how he's doing.
... Yes?
Wait!  Professor...?
Then, goodbye.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Will he understand Spanish?
Coffee might be nice.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
Why is he doing this?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
He isn't going to breathe.
But... how is he going to breathe?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
In the spring when he melts!
I'll have to talk to the driver.
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Who... Who is that?
