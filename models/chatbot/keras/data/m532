Evening, Annie.
I'll knit you a sweater.
If I go to jail...?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
I'm going to tell the truth.
What are you going to do?
...you think that's right...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
Carla was in the car, right?
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
But it'll stop the movie.
But that's what happened.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
What am I gonna do?
I saw...
What is it all about?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Lookit that, up already.
Well ain't you amazing.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Not without a rolltop desk.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
...and we could get up every morning...
Now you're talking...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Yes...
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Oh yeah.
Yeah, you?
Sleep well?
Good morning.
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Pelting down out there.
What?
You know what else a man can do?
That's something a man could do...?
You'd do the newspaper right here.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
Did as of last week.
It does?
Press still works.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
What would you do with it, the printshop...
...what...?
Gosh, you look nice.
How's your star?
I'd love to.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Is it...
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
No, that's true.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
I told them what you said about the script...
What?
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Going home.
Where you going?
Hi.
Hi.
...take <u>any</u> two people...
That's right...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...yes.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
I hurt you?
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
<u>Please</u>...
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
What've you got?
It used to be the Old Mill.
What's the scene...
I can't get it to come out right.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
Go you Huskies!
Yes.
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Why?
Sure did.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
I used to go out with a politician.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
But it's absurd.
I do if you do.
You believe that?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Because I'd met someone else.
You can do it.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Then I'll come back, then.
Later on.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
...because if you don't, they die...
Why?
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Oh.
The other side.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Read the card.
Thank you.
You going to ask me in?
Hi.
One moment.
It's for your finger.
I don't drink.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Oh, God...
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
You have to sign for it.
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Would you go in...
"Room Service!"
Great.  Who is it...?
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
Gonna' be good as new.
Better idea...
Fix my glasses.
Paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Never saw the point of 'em.
You like kids?
You got a paperclip?
...lost the screw...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
What are you doing down there?
What?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
Uh huh.
Cast stood me up.
What happened?
That's for sure.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
I thought you had Play Practice.
Hello.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Yes.
Me?
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
No, I don't...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
<u>How</u>...?
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
I...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
About <u>conflict</u>...
<u>Yes</u>...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
Well, first, you got to change the title...
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
I <u>can</u>?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
How can you <u>say</u> that?
You'd know better'n me.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
I love your script.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You're still here.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
What are you doing?  I love your script.
Hi.
Mister White is...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
...who...?
...that.
Yes...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Mmm.
...such a pleasant sound.
...I always thought so...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
Surest thing you know.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
I live there.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
Everyday things...yes.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
That whole...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
And likewise.
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Of course.
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
As the Old Mill goes around...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
I understand...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Yes...
That: in an act of...
No, no, I see...
But, but but but...
Yes...
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
That's true.  You grow up here?
You get what you pay for.
It was either that, or a sardine.
But why the dalmation?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
It's...
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
I...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
It's about life.
Why?
Yes.
You like my play.
It's in your play.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Why did you quit?
I quit the movie.
You quit.
I quit.
I beg your pardon?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
"Anguish."
What's it called?
You haven't heard of it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
Well, it had sentimental value.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
The people in New Hampshire.
Who?
I have one, but they lost it.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I want to rent this one.
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
I need a typewritter.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...

He works on the movie.
Who is this person that you've found?
I'm sorry.
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
I wasn't doing business.
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I have to tell you something...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
I've been thinking.
Where have you been...
We did...?
We had a date.
Hi!
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
I beg your pardon?
That's so beautiful...
Ten thousand dollars.
What are they offering?
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Yes, that's right.
What, what what are you doing here?
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...

And I might have something important to tell you...
Go you Huskies...
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Drama Group?
After Drama Group.

Waal, that's what I'm saying.
Water or mineral deposits.
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
...I'm sure that people are upset...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Morning.
Morning, darling.
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
What're you doing here...?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
We'll work it out...
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Big day last night.
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Mornin', Doc...
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Well, where do they hold court?
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
What?
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Courthouse back in town.
What courthouse?
They know what her tits look like.
It'll hurt the box office.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
They're holding it for ransom.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Hi.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
And I need a drink.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Wat...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
He's on the ph...
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
This horse is booked.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Fifteen hands.
How big is this horse?
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
It's Marty on the Coast -
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
Fourteen year old girls.
Now: I'm looking at the...
...they run on water.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
I will.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Waterford, Vermont.
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...why am I here...?
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
That Could Be.
They think it's your First Wife...
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
That's right.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Nothing happened.
Bobby, don't say anything.
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
What'll I do for fun?
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says <u>here</u>...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
She wasn't in the...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Mornin, sister.
I'm having dinner with W...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
It's...
Isn't he...
I loved it...he...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
I swear that that woman in my room...
Her...
You got to get out of here...
I...
Are you all right...?
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
Nice town that you've got here.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.

How old are you?
Bourbon and Milk.
What do you drink?
Sure, what have you got?
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
The prices are going up.
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
You do...?
I'm ready!
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
You mind...?
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
I've always seen that.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
Just him and me.
Joe, the writer?
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
Everybody needs a hob...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
Are you Okay?
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
No, you're absolutely r...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
You can go...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
What I...
What...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
She's a...
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
We've got three days to...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
What else?
If there's anything I...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
You have to what?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
Could I see it please...?
Of course he...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I'm very sorry to...
Mr. Barrenger.

No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?

The Mayor's outside.
Izzat so?
There's other things to be learned.
Aren't you ever in school?
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
It's night.
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
We know that you weren't.
I wasn't in the car.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Then what is the...?
No.
Well, what's the beef?
Nobody.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
I, uh...  Um...

I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Thank you.
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...

Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I want you to hear this.
Get him on the...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Get him on the phone.
Who is her agent...?
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
...we had a script conference...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...

Will you help me out...?
Oh.

Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look.
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Why?

Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
She's absolutely r...
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Marty...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
Bob are you alright...?
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Hello.
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
He treated me as if I were a child...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...yes...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
I know...
The minute I read that script I said...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I'm only trying to...
An artist of your caliber...
I...
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
We, we have to give it.
And you know what...?
Yes.
...wants a piece...
...yes...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
I know, I know.
Wally...
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...I know...I know...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...I...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
What?
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
...I can't do it, Wally...
Who are these from?
I...I...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
Is...Is the Movie!
I know that...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
You can't do what?
I can't do it, Walt.
What...?
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Yes, yes, but...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Yeah.
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
This is Joe White.
No, no...Please.
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
We're just talking about the...
Claire, Bob Bar...
I just...
Claire, when did you...
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
That's cor...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
I'll put the, in your r...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
-- she's got 'religion.'
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
She won't stop crying...
Why not?
I can't tell.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
That isn't very nice.
Did she throw up?
Yes.
You show Claire these sketches?
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
You said <u>three</u>...?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Who got their heads cut?
What?
Well.
Kiss my ass.
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Why?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Where you off to?
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Doug...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
...he's the producer of the movie.
Doug, this is Mr...
I have to talk to you.
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
Doug, the traffic light...
Main Street.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Gut Yuntif.
And what was it you wanted to say?
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
What's in the case?
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
I...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
Hi.
Okay...
Later for you, pal.
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
He didn't have to tell...
He told you that...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
You were in the car with Bob?
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
This young woman.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Arrest him.
What is the...?
Arrest him.
You bet he did.
He saw the girl in the car...
Sure.
He saw the accident...?
The writer.
Who's White...?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
What?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
A witness to what...?
I had a witness I would.
You should.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
He should be put in jail.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
My wife just went into labor...
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
Yes.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
Mmmm.  You have children?
How about that.
My wife's going to have a baby.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
I'm looking for the writer.
I...
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
I...?
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Not now.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I can't find the writer.
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
I'm very sorry I...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
I...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
Town's out of lilacs.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
It burnt down.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
For what cause?
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
So be it.
Then you're finished in show business.
The girl was in the car.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
I have to tell the truth.
No, what is it?
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
I treated you like a son or nephew.
The girl was in the car.
I don't getcha.
I'm out.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
You want me to lie.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
I've got a date.
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
I'm gonna nail it.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
I hurt my finger.
Why?
Why?
I can't.
Where have you been...?
What's the...
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
I don't drink.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
Um, no.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I know you do.
I want to make a good film.
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I grew up on your mov...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Grace...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I know the feeling.
I can only write on a manual.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
We're out of money.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
I...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You didn't see it...
I don't...
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I don't know.
How do you know you saw it?
I didn't say anything to them.
What did you say to them...?
No.
How do they know that, you told them?
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
I can write it.  I can't type it.
You can't write it?
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:
I...
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
...would you excuse me, please...
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
<u>Siddown</u>!
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
Hi!
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
My oh my.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
It's lovely.
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
What is that...?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Do something.
Is he cool or angry?
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Mmm.
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Wally...?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Yeah?
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
There's no witnesses...
She wasn't in...you were al...
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
He's got a gift for fiction.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Is that one hell of a kid?
We got the permit.
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
If you do the product placement...
<u>Find</u> it.
We don't have the money.
Pay her off.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Find the money.
I don't got the money.
<u>Pay</u> her.
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
It's just a formality.
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
Marty...
Like dykes and dogs.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
That's what I said.
<u>Stop</u>...
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
I'm gonna' bring it off.
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
What's in all the bags?
They're coming Fedex...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
How was your flight?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
I left that for you.
You cool the broad out?
Sherry, Sherry...
I want them thrown in jail.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I've got two days to get this house...
Sherry, this...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
...not the Lazyboy...
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
So we just got lucky.
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...
George, that is so kind of you.
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
...it is?
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...the city council...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
...not at all...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
Why would they be illegal?
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
And we're glad to have you here...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Zat true?
Ain't no second chances in life.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Bet you did.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
You think so?
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
It takes all kinds.
She coulda done better than him.
Mmm...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
...the damn thing...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
Yes, I hear it.
You hear that?
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Why?
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
...we can't lose the wind...
We have to lose the window.
Givvem a cigarette...
Where are we?
