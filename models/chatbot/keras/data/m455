They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
They done that too long in my family.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Yeah.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Come on, honey.
No thanks.
Want me to come?
Out.
Where' you goin'?
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Give her a beer.
Hell, you got steady work.
You think so, Frankie?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
What d'you say, Duff?
See Duff. He's the money man.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
It sure is.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
All right, you get out of here, man!
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
You in a big hurry, boy?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Boy - you hear me?!
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Fill her up?
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
What d'you think?
Want to keep your job, boy?
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Well, what d'you know?!
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Used to be. On the railroad.
You a union man?
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Okay.
Want to talk to you.
That's right.
'You Duff Anderson?
Anderson.
What did you say your name is?
Walker and Williams.
Where was that?
Yeah.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
I know.
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
I'll smile when it's funny.
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I said: Cut it out!
I don't know.
Where's he at?
People seen him 'round.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Okay.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Like where?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
I been sendin' her money.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
She done moved to Detroit.
Where's Wilma?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
What d'you want?
Just so you do your work.
Guess I don't.
Don't say much, do you?
Thanks.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Okay.
How 'you doing?
Name's Duff.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Okay, thanks very much.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Any other family?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
And his age?
Well, he worked around.
His profession?
I don't know.
Where was your father born?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Have anything in mind?
Guess so.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Thanks.
Okay, I will.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
That's two bucks, Joe.
Oh yeah? That's good.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Yeah, I been there.
Been over to the other mill?
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
Oh yeah?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Okay.
How 'you doin' man?
Like hell they wouldn't.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
Duff--
Okay.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
I don't think that'll happen.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Where're you going to go?
Well, that'll be the first time.
There's nothing to say.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Duff, I love you.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
What d'you mean?
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
How come you don't hate their guts?
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
You heard me!
Watch out!
Don't do that!
What're you going to do?
No point fixin' it!
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Day work.
What the hell could you do?
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Yeah!
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
About ten dollars.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Hi.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
We can always do that, Duff.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
They won't.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
You will.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Don't deny me, Duff.
Yeah.
Don't, Duff.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
I keep thinking about him.
How come you keep askin'?
What about your boy?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
We'll be all right.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Well, I haven't come around.
You jivin' me?
Don't look so scared.
Huh?
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Go on - hit me!
I don't want to hurt you.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
My kids want me to teach them.
Uh-huh. Why?
You know how to box?
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
You still didn't answer my question.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You didn't answer my question.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Am I as good as they?
What about them?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Everything you cook is good.
Come here, baby.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's so.
Is that so?
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
He could live with us.
What about him?
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Don't call them that.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Yeah?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Well, what d'you think?
I can see why.
No. But a small one.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
What about that girl?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Don't push me, Duff.
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
What happened, Duff?
How about it?
Thank you.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
What d'you mean?
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Okay, I guess.
Your boy.
What?
How did it go?
I thought you wasn't comin'.
Hi.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
What's he like?
Four.
How old is your boy?
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
I'll see you later.
That's right.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Surprised?
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Are you married?
Yeah. Well, I do.
I didn't know you had one.
Goin' to see my kid.
Just for the day?
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
What d'you mean?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
That's the way he is.
Ain't your fault.
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
No.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
'Been up north?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Why did you?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Good night, Duff.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
What?
Oh yeah, and then what?
No, on the porch.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
I wouldn't have let you.
You almost got into trouble back there.
What d'you mean?
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
But I would like to see you again.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
Not here, Duff.
Scared, huh?
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
That's why you come back, huh?
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
How come you stay 'round here?
Take it easy.
Let's go, Duff.
Don't Duff--
Get out of here!
You got a problem all right.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
How d'you mean?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
That's right.
They must work on the section gang.
What is it?
Hell!
Go on - you can have one!
No thanks.
How about another beer?
I like a place with lots of life.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
No.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
How d'you mean?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
What d'you expect?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Maybe.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
That's right.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
My father's the preacher.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Yes, aren't you?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Your folks live there?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
In Birmingham.
Went to college, huh?
I'm a teacher.
You work around town?
Oh yeah?
Yeah. On the section gang.
You working?
No. I'm new in town.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
You must be new in town.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
'Got a good thing, man.
Good-bye, Frankie.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
That's right.
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
What 'you signifyin'?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Like a home, for one thing.
Like what?
A whole lot, Frankie.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
We was just leavin', fellows.
I bet she's easy jam.
How 'bout the key?
Just get her drunk.
Take it easy, Frankie.
What's so hot 'round town?
'Round town.
Where' you goin'?
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
What you gettin' all pretty for?
'Bye, Jocko.
'See ya.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
They all got families to support.
Yeah, see you in hell.
See you, Duff.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Better get him to a hospital.
Couldn't get the words out before.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Take it easy, Pop.
Beat it!
That's right.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Great.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
I heard you.
I asked you somethin', boy!
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
'Don't sound so sure.
No.
Plannin' on getting married?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
What happened?
Okay.
How about a drink?
Yeah. That's right.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
What's on your mind?
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
I'm Duff.
Who're you?
'You Will Anderson?
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
I said, she's in great shape.
What did you say, boy?!
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
She don't look no worse to me.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Sorry.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
She'll do.
Seems a little loose!
Okay.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Just tryin' to be helpful.
No, thanks.
Want me to hold the light for you?
Okay.
How you doin', boy?
Good-bye, Duff.
Who is?!
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Don't be too hard on him.
Okay.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
How 'you gonna live?
No, they won't.
They'll run you out.
That's right.
Going back, huh?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Well, what're you going to do?
Sure.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
No thanks, Lee.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Come on, Pop.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Come back some other time, will you?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
How often is that?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often does he get like that?
I'll be seeing you.
Oh yeah?
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
It's for your own good.
So I been told.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
It ain't in me.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Don't look like there's a right way.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
I guess not.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I doubt it.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I guess I ain't.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Thank you.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Guess it's never been easy.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
All right, son.
How are you?
Hello.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
'Musta knocked her up.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
How you doin'?  Hi there!
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Well, I got married to one of them.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
That'll make the folks very happy.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
I know.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I understand.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Anything you say, baby.
Let's go.
Right here.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
What's the matter now?
Got a thick feelin' here.
Like hell you ain't!
I ain't drunk, honey.
Now you stay put!
Okay, boy, beat it.
He's your son.
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Shut up, Will.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Pour your own trouble, Will.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Let's stay here, Will.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
No. Why?
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Come on, Will.
He's my son!
Hi.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
