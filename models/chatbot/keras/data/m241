But you better hurry.
Either way works for us...
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Would you shut up?
Also like sex with my wife.
The key is don't look down.
Just like sex with my wife.
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Uhh! Would you die already!
Merde! Just missed!
Exactly.
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Ha-ha!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
No it isn't! You're dead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
AHHHHHHH!
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
I don't know... Surprise me.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Yeah. Apparently.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
God. How can you eat like that?
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Andy...
Oh God. Shit...
You too.
Okay. Be careful.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Right.
Well, they are French.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Whoa...
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
What does it say?
It's making me hungry.
What?
God. I can't believe it.
Really.
No wonder he let her go.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Didn't even have to ask.
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
Where?
I know where he'll go.
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
We don't both have to die.
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
What...?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Fuck me...
Holy mother of God...
Yeah. French fries...
I hope they fucking fry us all.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
What the fuck!? You too!?
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Are you crazy!?
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
They're coming!
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I don't know...
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
A cure?
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy! No!
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
What?! He told you? When?
I know. He told me.
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Are you okay?
Hello?
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Serafine...
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
This looks familiar...
A la votre.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Don't you want to change?
It's okay. I can see fine.
What about your glasses?
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
So... you feel okay now?
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Serafine...?
Andy! Holy shit!
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Andy!
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
And who's Claude?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Like an underground club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Uh-huh. Good for you.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
What?
Salots! Shitfucker!
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Sure. I can follow that.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Shit!
Pull over! Now!
No... I...
You on drugs? Huh?
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Looks like he lied to you too.
Nothing's happening!
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Another step and he's dead!
Sure. Don't you?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
What's the problem?
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
The ADM. Let's go.
And you call me a moron...
Claude...?
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
You'll never get the chance.
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Before the coma!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
What about me?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
Oh no... no....
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Oh shit... No...
We know you were with her.
What?!
You recognize her?
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
I told him it wasn't ready...
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Because Gaston was after it.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Uncle Terrence.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Why the fuck would I do that?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Not you too -
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Yeah?
Andy...
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
What?
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Psychic awareness. Right.
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Claude.
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Uncle Terrence, you're...
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Where is it! Please!
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Sort of...
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Andy? Andy is that you?
Uncle Terrence?
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Shit. I feel sick.
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Alright. Let me write a letter.
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Not that I know.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Why would he pick this one?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
What do you mean, maniacs?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Jesus...
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Enough. Cut him loose.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
You fucking liar!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Andy!
Allo?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Yes sir.
Now!
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
What did she say?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What've you got?
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Saint Severin...
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Double merde.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Merde.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Well?
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Here.
He says -
Merde.
