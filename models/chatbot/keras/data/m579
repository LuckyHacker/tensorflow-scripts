Let's let Molly open one.
Which one can I open first?
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Here!  In the car!
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Woody!  Buzz!
What?  What is it?
Hey!  Wow!
Bye, house.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
But what if we leave them behind?
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Right here in the van.
Where was the last place you left him?
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Next stop...
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Yeah?!
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Can I help pump the gas?
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Okay...
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
But Mom, I can't find him!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
No, I haven't seen him.
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Just one?
You can bring ONE toy...
Can I bring some toys?
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
To infinity and beyond!
Oh, yeah!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Okay.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Yeah!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Whadda ya think?
Wow!  Cool!
Mm-hmmmmm.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Rocky!  The ramp!
We're almost there.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
What are you doing over there?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
We're not aiming for the truck!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Not today!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Ha-ha!!
Hold still, Buzz!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
The match!
Woody!  The rocket!
Great!
Look out!!
Well, thanks for the ride.
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Hold on, Woody!
Woody!
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
What?!
Shhhhhhh!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Yes Sir!
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
But why would Andy want me?
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Yeah, right.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Come on, this way!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
What happened to you?
Shhh!
Don't tell me what to do!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Woody, stop it!!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Shield your eyes!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Spaceship.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Sorry.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Go away.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
According to my nava-computer, the --
No.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Right?  Buddy?
Then we've no time to lose!!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Trouble?!  Where?!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
I could have stopped him.
You mean that happy child?
THAT is Sid!
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
That's why.  Sid.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
I'd better take a look anyway.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
What's going on?
Where?
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Can!
You can't!
Yes, I can.
No, you can't.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Excuse me.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Toy?
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Watch yourself!!
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Hello-o-o...
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Something's screwy here.
Everyone, it's Woody!
Hi!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
What's with him?
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Stay calm, everyone!!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Murderer!
Oh, that is disgusting.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
How 'bout three out of five?
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Are you peeking?
Heh-heh.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Miss.  G-6.
B-3.
I got dibs on his hat!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Hey, watch it!
I can't see a thing!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
No she's NOT --
She's sick!
Hey!!
Look!  Janie!
What?
Oh no, Hannah!
I don't know!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I dunno.
Did I get my package in the mail?
What?
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Will you quit moving around?!
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
That ain't no happy child.
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Have you been replaced?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Oh, no!
No, no, no, wait!
Toss 'im overboard!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
You murdering dog!
No!  No, no, no, no!
Nothing.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
You are a liar!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Who is it this time?
Alright!  That's it!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Laser-envy.
A lunchbox...?!
A lunchbox?!
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Okay, save your batteries!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
I was close to being scared that time.
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
ROOAAAARR!!!
He got it, Woody!
I got it, Woody!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
I thought he was at summer camp!
It's Sid!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
What the heck is up there?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
They're getting bigger.
I can't quite make out -- 
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
There.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Last present!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Yes SIR!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
Sir!  No Sir!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
That's right.  Your toys.
W-w-w-we?
It's busted.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
What?!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Huh?
Reach for the sky!!
Sid!!!
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!

This is ludicrous.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Uh-oh.
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Slink!  Hang on!
I can't hold on much longer!
Speed up!
Woody!  Speed up!
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Woody?!
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Got it.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Bad news?!
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
No, Slink --
I'm red this time.
Right here, Woody!
Hey, Slinky?
