As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
What about the shit they write?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
The whole thing  painting.
Of what?
Do you ever get sick of it?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
Let's get out of here.
Naa..
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
What do you think?
I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
Not sure. How was yours?
When's your show?
I don't know.
Is this finished yet?
Rene's been telling me about your work.
Hey  it's the big A.M..
Really. Huh. Too bad.
I'm a painter, too.
No. Should I have?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Oh, I didn't know that.
It's in New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
New York.
It's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
We can do better. It needed more white.
That was my favorite part!
I don't like beer.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
Piss painting?
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
What's with the wigs?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Do you still love her?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
What's wrong?
Ouch..
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Cool.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
That's good. At least they're interested.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Yeah, I met her already.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
You don't even work on your stuff!
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Ten bucks apiece.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ignorant art?
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
You should talk to him about this.
How much for these five?
Aren't they?
These are great.
No.
Is Jean Michel here?
Who?
Annina Nosei.
Who is it?
Sure.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Jean, your parents are here.
I know.
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
How about right now?
When?
You want a drink?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
You name it, I paint there.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
You haven't been by lately.
No.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
How do you know?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
Who did this?  Who did this?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
What do you mean?
I didn't see you.
B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
Sure, ok..
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
I can get ten.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
I'm here.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
I need a dealer.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
Should there be?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Who said that?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Yup.
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
Not black.
Not what?
You're not?
I'm not black.
What?
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
Yes, but as a black painter 
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
A primate?
You mean like an ape?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
What are they?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
They're just words.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Decipher?
... Can you... decipher this for us?
I hate this. Turn that off.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Very well.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Would you like to see the wine list?
What's wrong with you today?
Blue? Where?
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Use your fucking instinct.
You want me to put it here?
Yeah..
 In this corner?
Still not here.
It's Andy again.
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Out?
Paint it out.
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
Drugs??!
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Come on, let's get out of here.
I guess it was a long time ago.
She's good.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Good. What do you have?
I don't really have any problems.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Good.
I ain't John Henry.
What's the rush, John Henry?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
You gonna carry that around all night?
For real?
We got beat.
Come on in!
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
Hi Gina.
Check you later, man.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
So then what?
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Who's John Henry?
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Oh  you mean black people!
Your people.
About what?
You're shattering all my myths.
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
You got a date already?
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
Oh yeah..
SAMO.
Who am I?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Who's that?
Willie Mays.
Hey  Willie Mays.
What's his name?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
George?
That is amazing. What year is it?
Forget it.
What's that about?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
Pretty much the same.
How is he?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
Don't you think he's using you?
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
A present I picked up for you.
What's that?
Hi.
Hi.
You're your own baby.
What's wrong with me?
You mean babies with you?
... babies.
Think so?
It looks done.
Staten Island would be ok.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
I hadn't thought about it.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
Well thanks!
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
You want some?
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
Basquiat, what did you take?
I'm your family.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
It's Monday morning.
You're back.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
... What's the matter?
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
What who's saying?
Do you know what he's saying?
You don't have any fucking money..
... I'll buy you some new ones.
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
I thought you hated this place?
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
Party girls? Can I call you?
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
You do! You definitely do.
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
I think I could do that alone.
Can I walk you home?
Guess I just got sick of him.
I guess you did.
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar  I'll get the rest.
It's three thousand dollars!
I'll take the whole tin.
Yeah, it's the best one.
Is that the best quality you have?
You only want one Big Mac?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
What's your name, man?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
Would you check out my studio some time?
That's great.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Me? Why?
I really... admire you.
Thanks
See you later.
Stand still.
Some of them.
You like your dad's paintings?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Hi.
Hi.
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
You're a fast mover.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
I don't eat junk food.
Have a Mac.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Wanna Mac?
Come on.
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
How can I ever thank you?
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
What? What do you want?
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
You see? You have someone to live for.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
That's a beautiful name. French?
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
Hey, Rene.
Forget it.
I'll make you another one.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
I can't. After the show.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
That one's for you.
5:11.
What time is it?
So shut up and keep painting..
So what?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
So keep painting.
My point exactly.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Jean Michel Basquiat.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Can you put me in the ring with him?
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
I didn't know.
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
You don't have any!!!
Yeah.
'Phillips head,' right?
Yeah.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
A what?
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
I need this?
I need this?
I just don't think you're being fair.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
OK! Goodbye!
That's ignorant.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
Uh-oh!
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
