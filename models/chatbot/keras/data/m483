What--special autopsy?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Did I?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Did she talk?
Just before she died she came to--
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He's inherited a fortune.
Indeed, he has often told me.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
Did you wish to see someone?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
I don't know--I can't tell--
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
You--a friend to me?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
Maybe you want my money, too.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
I don't know, [I tell you].
Who are you? What is your name?
No-
Why didn't you notify the police?
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Maybe you're right.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
But where do the rats come in?
That's it. You get it quick.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Thousands?
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
Come on, we're wasting time.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Take me down there.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
What's that?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
You here again?
I'd like to have a look.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
What's down there?
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Well, news of Buckley?
How do you do.
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
You found Buckley?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
How? What can I do?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
I'm going to call the police.
What are you going to do?
He isn't here.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
