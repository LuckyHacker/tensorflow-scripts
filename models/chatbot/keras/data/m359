"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
What is that?
Drop me off?  How do you mean?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Going?  How do you mean?
Where are you going?
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
You're all just jealous.
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
Who brought up this bright idea?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
No more... I can't!
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Same thing.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Sure.
Do you want a beer or not?
What?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Barely.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
You're too clean for me.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
What're you doin'?
I vote for the hammock.
I vote for me.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I'll think of something.
Think you can figure it out?
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
How do we do it?
If you insist.
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
How about a roll in the hay?
Not now.  I'm cold.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
What're you doing?
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
I don't know...
Why don't we go take a swim?
Where's Shelly?
What was that?
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Breakfast?
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
Cool it, Andy.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
What're you gonna do?
Be a man, man.
Will you come with me?
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Don't do that to me!
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
What's the matter?!
It's Friday the 13th.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
This is all the exercise I need...
Maybe we should do some exercise.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
It's dark down there.
I love you, man!
I'm a slow eater.
Chuck... look.
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
Yes, man!
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
A hammock?
Your bed.
What's this?
You go ahead...
Come on down!
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
What are they saying?
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Which one is it?
Sort of.
You know him?
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Could we move a little faster?
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
You promised you'd never ask me.
What happened that night?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
And, what about us?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Why did you come back here?
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
What do you mean?
It's deceiving.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
This is too painful to look at.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
Are you all right, Shelly?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Somebody was in here.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Did you stay here last night?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Nothing.
What?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
I don't know.
Is that so bad?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Hello.  How are you?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Why?
Derek... stop.
You're wrong.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
I never said you were "nothing".
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
I just want you to like me.
You don't "have to."
I have to.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
Damn you, Shelly!
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Don't say any more.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
It was nothing.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Bullseye!
You're the boss.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
What're you doing?
Just keep your eyes on the road.
This is no time to celebrate!
Maybe.
Got any good ideas?
Keep looking.
I don't see anything.
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
See anything?
Gulp!
Yes.
Are they following us?
May be please have the wallet.
Please... be cool.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Everything's gonna be fine.
Is... is everything all right?
Not us!  He's really creepy.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Why don't you help us?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
What are we gonna do?
Stick around and you'll see.
In that little thing?
My whole world.
What d'ya got in there?
I'm sorry.
You're Shelly?
Hi.
