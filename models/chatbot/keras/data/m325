This is Bishop.
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
And if you can't deliver them?
<i>$300,000.</i>
How much?
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>

<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
<i>Are you all right?</i>
What is it, Choco?
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
Who the hell is that?
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
<i>Morning.</i>
Morning.
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
What?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
What do you think, dumbshit?
Did it hurt?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
What about your toe?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
So what?
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.

Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
<i>He killed two children.</i>

Okay.

<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
I don't know. They might be dead already.
<i>What happened to them?</i>
<i>The FBI was breathing down Lateesha's neck... and she assumed that they were onto our scam. So she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist. They have been under FBI surveillance for the past 6 months.</i> <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN </b> Claremont drives like a maniac.
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT

Yep.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
No. Please enlighten me.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]

Take us to Vegas.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.

<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
That's the rumor on the street.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Yes.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
I don't know.
Where is the money?
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car.

Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
God help us. God help us all.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
I said stop it.
Cunt.
Stop it.
Cunt.
Must you use that awful word?
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.

Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
Something is going down. Something bad.
No. What's the big deal?
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
There are no bond certificates.

You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!

I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
How did you meet Choco?
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Really? Did you play in a band?
I was a musician.
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.

I can certainly think of one more!
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!

Not really.
Do you know where Danang is?
Many times.
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
