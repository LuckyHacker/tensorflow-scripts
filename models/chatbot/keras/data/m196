I look forward to reading your report.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Absolutely.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
You think they're still up there?
Not yet.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
You actually performed surgery...?
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
That'll be interesting.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
Are you saying they won't help us?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
It's Cochrane.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Yes...
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
Montana.  Energize.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
Bag him.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
Is it Japanese?
At least four hours.
How long has he been unconscious?
Do it.
I believe so.
Can you configure it?
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
No.
Vulcan?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Isn't it better like this...?
No... no, please... you cannot...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
Yes...
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
I'm your creator now.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
More lies.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I... do not want this...
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
No. I will not betray my friends.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Do you know what this is, Data?
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
I do not know what you are referring to.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
What year is it?
Contact Starfleet Command.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Where's the Sphere?
I have helm control.
What?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Ready quantum torpedo.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Dispersive armor is holding.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I am the Borg.
Who are you?
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
Did you know her?
But how?
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
What did you do to the batteries?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Where?
I told you, there's no --
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Juice?
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
We're crossing the threshold!
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Their com system must still be down.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Captain, the Enterprise!
One minute to warp threshold...
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
I'm on it...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
<U>Engage.</U>
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Entering the upper ionospere...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
What's still there?
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
No... the door's too thick.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Captain --
She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Always am.
Ready to make a little history?
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
I have the password right here.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
There should be an access hatch nearby...
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
How serious is the damage?
This must be it.
Let's go.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Understood. Keep me informed.
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Ready.
Main bus...
Active.
ATR setting...
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
There is no invasion...
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Invasion.
The invasion plans.
What do you want?
Not yet.
Something wrong with that?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Yes.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Huh.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
There's a few of us left.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
California. San Francisco.
Where are you from most recently?
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Where in the States?
You don't sound French.
Yes.
Great name. French?
Jean-Luc Picard.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Why?
That's impossible.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
No... I'm from France.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
No. It's a lot further than that.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
I have to...
You're leaving, aren't you?
I am not a thief...
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Or...?
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Some.
Friends from Cornell...
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
We?
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
I'd say you already have.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
How did you know about that?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Were the two of you... involved?
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
What makes you say that?
You're lying.
What?
'Fraid not.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
I can try.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Did you need something?
I'm very sorry.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Cochrane?
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Yes, he is.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Track their weapons fire.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Captain...?
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Life signs?
On screen.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Aye, sir.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Onscreen.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Aye, sir.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Fire!
Target locked!
Go to manual.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Steady as she goes.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Aye, sir.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
No, sir.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Yes, sir.
Return to our own time?
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Good luck, sir.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Captain?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Life signs?
Looks like they damaged the silo...
On screen.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Report.
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Worf... torpedo... now!
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Nothing.
Emergency override!
We've lost Bridge control!
Report!
Understood!
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
I'll keep that in mind.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Right.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Just a little queasy...
Are you alright?
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Destroy the deflector dish.
Agreed. Options?
We have to stop them from sending that message.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
What are they doing?
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What?
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
Hold that thought.
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
What are you suggesting?
I remember it made me sick.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Where the hell are they going?
They're bypassing Engineering...
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Wil... Data was down there.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Someone...?
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Report.
Commander... we have a problem.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Worf? Is something wrong?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Riker here.
Worf to Bridge.
What kind of message?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
Even Data?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Target...
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
