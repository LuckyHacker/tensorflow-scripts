No way...  ...I wanna rock!
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Alright, alright.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
What?  Who pulled it out?!
Go out and plug the cord back in.
What?
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Who's Horace?
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Great.  Just great.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Oh, jeez.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
We're gonna scare him?!
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Why?
Darren, we better turn around.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Sheriff, you better take this.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Happy Friday the 13th.
Whaddya mean?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
I wish it was.
Is that all you found?
Better call an ambulance first.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
I could swear I heard...
Ahh, nothing.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
....with a woman's touch.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Never should've let her play.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Yeah, that's fat too.
My ass.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
No.  No, it's not...
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Daddy, what is going on?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
...And I said, shut up!
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
What it is?
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
But, Dad, we...
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Jason who?
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Did you hear me?!
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
I hope so.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Lake Forest Green?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Wait a minute. I just...
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Come and get it.
Okay, give it back.
'Cause it stinks.
Why?
No.
There...Ya happy?
What's it to ya?
So what are ya drawin'?
It's just beginning.
It's all over.
Okay.  There's one.
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Uh...yes.  But...
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
What?
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
But what I get scared again?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
We'll scare 'em right back.
But what if they try and scare us?
Who ya calling?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Huh?
That's debatable.
Are they grown-ups?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Why?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
I found it outside.
Where'd you get this?
No more.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
Nancy.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
You mean you had a bad dream.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
So what happened?
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
What's goin' on?
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
He didn't say anything?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Yeah, we're here.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
You gotta be kidding!
Boy scouting.
Which is?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
So where's Cort gone off to?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Please don't do anything crazy.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
I've seen it.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Yes!
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
There's no time for this bullshit...
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Yes, but they released me because...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Will you listen, dammit!
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
