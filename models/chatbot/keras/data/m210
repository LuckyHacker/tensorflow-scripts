I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
Was that it? Well, ok.
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
You're wrong.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
You sent them. I had no choice.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
I'm looking for my friends.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
Where are they? Last chance.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they?
I hate that picture.
What? Call the police?
I think we should get some support?
Where is it? This place?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
The strip joint?
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Yeah. I sure will.
I was hoping you'd find out.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
You think I'm crazy.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Two down. Two to go.
Dream on.
Check and mate.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
We won't.
Tell her... we'll get him.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
You killed her. I saw it.
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Fuck! What do you want?
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
Keep that thing away from me.
Think maybe knives do?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
That was a fucking hollow point!
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What did they give you?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
Who are you?
Wrong. Answer.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
I don't know you, man.
You lied at my trial.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
Where the fuck did you come from?
Sssshhh. She's resting.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
The scar.
Fucking Zombie.
Good thing in a situation like this.
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
I was talking about you.
You're him. Corvis.
How can you die if you're already dead?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
Nobody.
The scar. Which of you has it?
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Fuck. Me.
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I heard you were looking for this.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
... it connects you to me...
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Erin. Who?
It's not. I can't take it.
It's ok, it's ok...
It's what Lauren would do.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
My father.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
Have to find him first.
So you're going to kill him?
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
I don't want to see!
This tree. Here's where it happened.
Yes I do, I really do.
No. You don't.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Erin. It's not your fault.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
No...
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
Are you ok?
Yeah, I know.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
No! Why are you haunting me?
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I told you, I knew your sister.
Daisy. How did you know?
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
How do you know?
He didn't kill her.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
Someone else did it.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
Your father gave them to both of you.
Yeah, no kidding.
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
I know her friends.
I was a friend of your sister's.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Just don't believe everything you see.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Sign of the dead come back to life.
Fucking crow.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Could say that.
They botched the execution.
Good for you. You do know something.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
You know.
I know.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Shut up.
Yeah, we do.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
I do. Every day.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
An accident, Nathan.
You killed my daughter.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
I mean Lauren.
You mean Alex.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
What did I say?
Look, can I just call a cab?
I want you... to bend over.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Not tonight. Honest.
But you, you've had them.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
What's with your friend there?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
Anything wrong?
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
Please. Come inside.
I don't believe you.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Sweetheart...
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
About you.
They killed her because she found out.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
No.
You killed her!
It's not what you think.
You're in with them.
Looks like you have them both on.
I think I dropped an earring.
He said he'd prove it.
It still doesn't mean...
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
What? What is it?
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
What is it?
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Are you ok?
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What were you yelling about?
Watch out!
Erin!
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Honey. I just can't.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Just hold on to me.
Why are there so many?
