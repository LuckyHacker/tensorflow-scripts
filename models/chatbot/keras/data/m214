But there's nothing here.
Yes.  Just about here.
Around here.
This is it?
... Well, you wanted to see it.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
But you're only a mud carrier.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
No...
I think we should go on by ourselves.
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
What happened?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
What kind of stories?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
The Hall of Books.
Where?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
What else can they do?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
And everyone looks like us?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Ah... no.
I'm training to be a high climber.
On the towers?
What do you do on the towers?
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
I had an accident.
Now how did you get hurt?
The journey is part of my work.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
I will...
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
I'll never forget this.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
I don't understand.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I won't leave you like this.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Vox...
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Vox --
This has to end.
End...?
This has to end.
How are your dreams now?
No...
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
What do you mean?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Why did they built it?
The air... the power.
What's it all for?
This way.
Vox?
Do you know which way?
Yes.
Machines?
Yes... Thank you.
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
This is the way in?
It's what they want you to see.
Oh, shut up.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Yes.
So, do we go on?
It was meant to.
Yes...
It frightens you.
My God... I saw this.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
What?
Send him away.
Last night.
When was his mother taken?
I'm used to that.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Yes.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Excuse me?
Because you'll never die.
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
We need your help.
Can you show us where they live?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
How have you survived so long?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
But you escaped.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Do you know where they live?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
You know of them?
Morlocks --
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Sir... have you a name?
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
What are you?
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
1899.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
How did you know?!
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
Because...
And why not?
I don't think that's going to happen.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
I'm tired of running.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
I know.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I'm a foolish man.
That was a foolish thing to do.
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
No...
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
Now will you go?
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
A man can change his history.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
You took her because she helped me.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
So you take their best...
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Why?
I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Say I just come back again?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
Why would you let me go back?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
What?
It can't all be like this...
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
And what of the Eloi?
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
How?
We make them see what we wish.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
As slaves.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
Created?
No, we created the Morlocks.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Alexander.
What's your name?
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I just love mechanical things.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
It's spectacular...
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Why is it -- breaking up?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
What's happening to the moon?!
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
I -- what are you?!
May I help you?
I have something for you...
Let them.
Let them.
Alex... people are staring.
It's only a machine.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
I've seen it.
Heavens, look at that now!
So it's astronomy now, is it?
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
We took a walk three days ago.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
My God...
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Alex...?!
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Alex, what is it?
All right...
No... let's walk through the city.
Let's walk through the park...
Not here... alone.  Please.
All right...
I need... to talk to you.
Darling.
Holding you... again.
Alex, what is it?
Trust me...
You know I can't.
Dance with me...
Got here as soon as I could.
You're late.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
A moonstone.
I know it's not a diamond but --
Hold on... I know I have it...
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
You're getting warmer.
I mean... well... affection.
Admiration?  My my.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
All right, what is it now?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
Talk away, Professor.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Well there's something new.
Sorry... I was distracted.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
What?
You promised me flowers.
Trust me...
You know I can't.
Dance with me...
Got here as soon as I could.
You're late.
His home.
This... was my home.
I'm glad.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Good night, Alex.
Good night, David.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
You won't say that in a week.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
That's absurd --
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't do that --
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I would.
You wouldn't believe me.
What is it?
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
Do you find her?
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I know that --
I live with it every minute of every day.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I care more about my life.  And yours.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Hiding?
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
For God's Sake, David --
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
Then why are you here?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
I'm sorry, David.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
I've been working.
Perseverance.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
She's gotten into your equations.
Oh?
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
How romantic...
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Nothing.
What?
In the future, we'll be better.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
You sound like my father...
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Where's the challenge in that?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
God, and I'm running late --
Tonight's the night?
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
I was not.
Do you know you were humming?
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Did you hear me, lad?
I don't understand.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Sir...?
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Thank you...
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
It was different then.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Mara -- what -- ?!
No!
Mara...?
Kalen...
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
Mara --
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
I could...
Go back to your own time?
Yes... I suppose so.
So you can use it now?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
It's undamaged?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
If you only knew...
Is it?
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes.
You lost someone.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
You know this?
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Orion's belt...
Alexander...?
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It must have been safe.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Did you have fires at night?
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Learning was important?
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
You liked it there.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
How do you decide?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
What are you?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Or mud carriers.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
I don't understand.
What's it all for?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I can see Kalen's point.
The mud carriers.
Yes.
And this is your "work"?
Thank you.
This is magnificent...
We share everything.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Every night.
All of you?
We all have that dream.
Yes!
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Good night.
Good night, then.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You can see so many here.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Thank you...
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
I will...
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
Is he all right?
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Why would you do that?
Why not?
Why?
More than 800,000 years.
How long ago?
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
That machine --
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Oh, that explains everything.
Then you can speak slowly.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
What makes you say that?
You're not from beyond the valley.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
He's gone to a better place.
Your husband is dead?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Mm.
His curiosity is amazing.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Is there a lot of illness?
Thank you.
Yes.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
How long did you travel?
Yes...
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
That'll be all.
May I get you some --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Tell him to go away --
Yes, sir, he --
Here?
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Do you have it?!
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Yes, sir.
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
Sir --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
No, sir --
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
And roosters.
Do they?
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Might I ask why?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Imagine that.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Exactly correct, sir.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
I see.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
You won't even try?
We are what we are.
Then it's time to change that --
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
We choose to believe it.
You know that's not true.
They've gone to a better place.
What do you mean?!
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
We don't know.
Where do they take them?!
I suppose so.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
My father has gone to a better place.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
I am the oldest.
Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
New Yorkers.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Why?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
I took a different route.
He said he traveled for two months.
No...
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
New Yorkers.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
What are your people called?
"Eloi"?
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
I did...
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Yes, sir.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
If I might explain, sir --
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
Sir, if I may --
Dean Fulton...
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
They're inside --
No, you're safe --
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
I am.  Are you a climber?
We'll see about that.
What's it like where you come from?
What did you do at night?
That's quite enough, Kalen.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Kalen...
How did you get hurt?
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Sir?
No, sir.
And you've no idea where he went?
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
For our sake, I hope not.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
