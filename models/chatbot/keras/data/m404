Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Don't feel bad.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
It hasn't adjusted.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Go on, you're tired.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
We're ready for you.
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
He's going with you, Doctor.
With those camera lights and...
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I can get it.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Go on, Doctor.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
What's your plan, Brody?
And a missing man.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
I'll need more men to look.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Shit.
Yeah.  Down there.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Sure am.
You buying?
It's Miller time!
Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
How many sharks have you killed?
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
No.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
I'm  fine.
Are you okay?
Only to myself.
You don't have to prove anything.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
But you --
I am.  You're not.
Michael, you're not going down there.
Me.
Who's going to do it?
That's right.
... Okay.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
How is he?
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Come on!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Somebody better get down there!
You wanted to know about a cave?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
I don't understand.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
Thirty feet???
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
What do you mean, we don't?
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
So?
It's a shark's tooth!
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
Yes, you can.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
Come on.
I have to get out of here.
Michael, take deep breaths.
Hydrophobia...
Honey, what is it?
Well, that's why you got it.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
So tell Calvin.
It's too soon to move him.
... He ought to put him in here.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
No,  I'm not going through there.
Yes.  It's faster.
... Mean through the tubes?
No, we'll go through here.
Sure.  Let's go.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Okay.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
What's up?
They said you'd be here.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
You don't.
Mmmm... you smell good.
Me, too.
Recovering nicely.
How's your patient?
Finally.
Sean, that's right...
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
You want me to stay?
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
Sounds wonderful.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
... Me, too.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
No, you're not.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
No.
Change your mind?
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Yes?
Kathryn...
Thank you.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Fine piece of engineering.
Bracelets.
What's that?
Here.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
I know I can capture it.
After what happened to us?
Yes.
You're going down there again?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
How the hell did it get in here?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Michael...
I'm okay.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
You all right?
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
Are you coming...?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
I talked you into this?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Make up your mind.
And leave me down here???
Up.
Where are you going?
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
That we swim.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
It's romantic down here.
I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
... Friggin' fish.
They just wanted to say hello.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Hi, baby.
Damn it!
Yes.
Are you scared?
No.
Honey... you all right?
Just put your mask on.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
What do I do now?
I don't have a choice.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Where's the rubber band?
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
They're coming with us?
Get out of here!
Not enough loving.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
It's his work.
I don't like what he does.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
And what else is bothering you?
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
How come?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
You called, Doctor?
Okay, bye.
Honey, I gotta go.
My imagination isn't that good.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
That macho pompous English --
See you later.
Yeah.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
I guess.
Pre-opening jitters.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
You will.  I'll see to it.
Hope I make it through both.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
What is it, 97 days?
Well, not much longer to go.
Want another one?
Thank you.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
She, Mister Hutton.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
He's big as a bloody bus!
How'd it get in here?!
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
Thanks to you.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Brian, he's coming around!
Believe me, I am.
Get ready to go.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
And here I thought I was charming you.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
That's because I am the shark.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Philip.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Some miss all their shots.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
And I like you.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
I like it when they wake up.
Why are you?
Not at all.
Thanks for helping.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Just watch it when he does.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Still sleeping.
How's sleeping beauty?
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Afraid I can't do that.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Why?
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Let's hope he knows that.
We're taking that shark alive!
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
What in hell is that?
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
You look like an orange worm.
So do I, love.
I want that shark alive.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Like hell!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
I will.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
No!
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
You can get killed!
That's preposterous!
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
I'm sorry.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
I told you, something's upset them.
No, no.  That won't do.
I can have them walk backwards.
I thought they were clever.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Make this quick!
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Yes, aren't we all.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Fine.  Have them do some.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Nobody told me.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Go where?
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
Not good enough.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
I should have never listened to Calvin.
Don't blame yourself.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Ten minutes ago.
When did this happen?
And big for his age.
He's a young one.
I know.
They still seem nervous.
I think they'll come out now.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
How you doing, Kelly?
Hi, Mike.
Someone's looking for you.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Thanks.
Sure.  No problem.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Hope with none of my girl friends.
He's missing.
Musclehead?
'Preciate it.
Sure.
Give me a ride?
SEAN!
Take it up!
He's diving!
Take it up.
It's okay, Sean.
Let's go, let's go!
What, hon?
No...  It can't be.
Goes up.
Now what's this do?
Told you you'd like it.
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Isn't this fun!
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
No, think of something else.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Come on, it's fun!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Yes, it's great!
The one that goes underwater?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
I don't know, what else is there?
Besides that.
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
Sean, do you have herpes?
Why you sonuvabitch...
Herpes?
As always.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
You were great out there!
And alone.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Come on!  Check this out!
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
How come?
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Sure am.
Are you really?
I'm a water-skier.
Depends on big brother.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
You like Florida?
I don't know, it depends.
How long you staying?
... Massachussettans aren't.
'Course they're also so rich.
Massachussettans aren't.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
Yeah, from Boston.
So, you just get here?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Can't help it... ahh...
Don't you dare.
Gotta sneeze.
Now what?
Ahhh, ahhh...
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
I am serious.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
I don't talk that way.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
What're you doing later?
Hold still, damn it!
The space shuttle has landed!
It's disappeared.
Yes, there is goes.
That?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
What?
Did you see that?
Always do.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
No way.
I'll go with you.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
You have a man near it?
Five hundred yards.
How far away is filter number four?
It's large enough...
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
The world's southern most reaches.
Oh...
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Polar bears in Georgia???
Polar bears.
What the hell's there?
No, South Georgia.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Buzz off.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Precisely.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Make sure you put this back.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Yeah, well I didn't!
Calvin said it was all right.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Hey.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
All right, hit those lights too.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Right, Mike.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
That's impossible.
It's not closing, Mike.
What kind of trouble?
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Sure.
We're in love.
She still talking to you?
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
Don't hurry back.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
You know Overman?
Something wrong?
Come on, let's go.
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
I want to see Kathryn.
Gee, it's good to see you!
Who's grown up?
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
That's Dad...
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Yeah, right.
He needs a haircut.
Took it this morning.
So was Dad.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
How'd you do in school?
... I'll go to McDonalds.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Sharks???
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Got a job for me?
Look great, don't I?
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
You want to show this?
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
That bugger moves fast.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
