I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
We're rich in what really matters.
You'll be rich!
No, Jane.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
All right.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Give or take a year.
3:30 I guess.
What time is it?
Just a hunch.
What...?
What makes you think she likes me?
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
You can build another one... with her.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Little black party dresses?
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
I didn't --
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
He might have hurt somebody.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
Who did the sushi?
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
And your sushi was remarkable.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Honey.  Let's go.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
She's only fourteen...
Maybe we should knock first?
I guess we open it.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
Three times.  Powerful number.
What happened?
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Here's something.
Then it should be here.
Of course I did.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
I feel really stupid.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
My God, we're back where we started.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
Wait.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
What about this Beetle guy?
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
That's all we need.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That little girl saw us.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
Not really...  what's this?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
I know.  I'm sorry.
<u>You</u> left me.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
They make gypsies look good.
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
That's my girl!
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
At least we won't have to worry about her.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Won't?  Or can't?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
What's she doing here?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
But I'm not hungry, are you?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Maybe this is heaven.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Cabin fever, hon?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
This is going to take some time.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Anything happen while I was away?
... Hmmm?
That's how long you were gone.
What?
Two hours.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
I am sitting.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
How's your arm?
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Oh... I'm sorry...
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Adam!
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Wave at the lion.
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Oh no.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Almost.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
She's ready.
Oh puh-leeze!
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
So can I?
I got an A!
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Did you get the paint?
Really.  I don't know.
What is going on?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
We were trying to scare your mother.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
Nobody else can.
Is this like a trick question?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
What?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Aren't you scared?
We're ghosts.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
Wait for who?
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Help vouchers?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Now, let's get rolling!
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
This is <u>my</u> town.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
Can you scare them off?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
You don't kill anyone.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
Aren't you dead?
<u>Out</u>.
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
Well, we didn't know --
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Handbook?  When...?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
We tried.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
No.  What's wrong?
Are you available?
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Just one daughter.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Just get some people out of our house.
You're the dead.
We're...
All right.  Who are you?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
What about Betelgeuse?
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
About what?
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
Our cemetery?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
No.  You don't want his help.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
No.
Yes.
-- Like you used to be?
What do you expect?  You're dead.
We're very unhappy.
We need help.  We deserve help.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
How'd you do on the science test?
Step... mother.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Life is just... too awful.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
I want to be dead too.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
No, wait!
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Tell the truth.
We're practicing.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
And live in what, our station wagon?
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
Your qu...?  But you're...

W... What is it?
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
... I will.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
You've got to help them.
So... You're ready for me now?
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
Just <u>say</u> it.
God, you're anatomically correct!
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
That's it!
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
Good girrrl!
Beetle!
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
I don't know what that signal means.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
No, dummy.  Two.
Three syllables.
Of course you do.
Yes.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
I... I don't know what your name is.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Yeah.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I think so.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
I want to get in.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Are you a spirit too?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Where'd they go?
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
They're dead.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
Otho?
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
He's your cousin.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
I think she's in with them.
Why not?
Just don't tell Lydia.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho'll know what to do.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
They're... not here anymore.
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Delia will cook...
I cannot believe this.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Answer your mother.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
The attic room is locked --
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
... sheets.
Stepmother's...
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
I'm lonely.
What?
... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
Stepmother.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Let me have it.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Where is your mother?
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Delia hates it.
What do you think, honey?
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Are they suffering?
Otho, can you do it?
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
I'm sorry already.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
It wasn't a joke.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
I saw some ghosts.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Any particular kind?
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
I don't know.
What's happening to them?
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Are they still here, Otho?
Look at the tiny figures.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Maybe Charles does.
You don't have a key?
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
Attic space.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Oh, as long as we're here...
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Is there much more of this torture?
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Viridian?  What is...?
Viridian?
What do you think?
Gooood!
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Okay?
I thought I saw something.
What's wrong?
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Hellooo!  How's school?
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Is this the key to the attic?
What happened to the people who used to live here?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Their wedding clothes.
Their wedding clothes.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
The attic.
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Why not?
They don't want to come down.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Otho, that's terrible.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
