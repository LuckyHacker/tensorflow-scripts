Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
Be careful with it.
Intelligence may not be the right word...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Was there such a thing?
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
They found this?
Yeah...right...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Why Sixpack?
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
And?
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
For this...you don't need to be.
I'm not a doctor.
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
He did.
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
What's wrong?
What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Be my guest.
You mind if I take a look at this?
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
Just get in yours!
Your suit, Becky!
I got hung up!  Try this!
Where the hell've you been?
Fuck your orders!
That's an order!
No!
Go on!
No.
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
No way...
Can you fix it?
Jesus Christ...
Crunch...Implosion.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
What dead one on the ship?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
He did.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
I thought they were your friends?
One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
What has?
It's got Hazy!
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
We're getting out of here just in time.
What?...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Doc eat already?
Stay calm!
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
DeJesus!  A readout!
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
How do you know it was Williams?
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?
Shit...
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
I can't see them!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Where's Jones?
We made it!
Can't we fix it?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
How much time does that give us?
We're on backup air.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
What are you doing?
Maybe they already have.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
They know, don't they?
The escape bubbles?
Shit!  He sent them all.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
What can we do?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
Has it helped?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Good...It's going good.
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
How's astronaut training?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
That was a loud one wasn't it?
Why can't we pick up his signal?
Sixpack?
You screw around like that again and--
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
I need more light on that, Four.
Still...you did the right thing.
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
What?
You did good...
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Oh, God, she's out there...
It bit me!
No!
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
Shut up, all of you.
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Excuse me, sir...
All right...
...I'd really have to show it to you.
What's wrong with it?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Something wrong, Cobb?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
What about our quota?
He's not at his station.
Where's Doc?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Roger.
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Twenty minutes...
What's your air reading?
I'm going inside.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Charge set?
No...she killed herself.
And it killed Bo?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Okay, number 23's full.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Okay.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Ahhhh!
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Forty-eight hours!
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
It shouldn't be a long delay.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Unfortunately.  We can't.
Do it.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Beautiful.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
I know that.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Thank you, Martin.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Timex...
Personal effects...
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
I signed-up for the stock option.
You got money in this tub?
How's TransOcean doing?
Not yet.
Made your million, yet?
Hook's on 24...
Yes sir...
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Who else...Sixpack.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
If he had his blinkers on--
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Take it off and let me have a look.
Itches like hell.
Still bothering you?
What was it?
It...almost got you.
What happened?
...and a Russian grandmother...
Bullshit.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
You read Russian?
Russian.
What the?...
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
You let him get away!
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
What's going on?
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
What music?  There ain't no music.
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
So that's all you do?...
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
Listen to it for Christsake.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
I'm going to kill it!
It's Sixpack!
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
He's tanking on us...
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
Who cares?
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
Look.  Water.
Under there?
Getting some food.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
How'd you do that?
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Twelve hours!
Typhoon?!
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Burritos...Enchiladas...
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
No fuckin' lie...
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Like a leech.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
It's had a meal.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
I'm going to try to remove it.
What are you going to do to him?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
The infirmary?...
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
Two hundred meters.
How far away is she?
I'm not touching you!
Answer them and quit kicking me!
It saw us!
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Are you sure you saw something?
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Don't spend all day down there.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
The shack...
The air's stopped.
What is it?
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
What is it?
Oh man, that's just great...
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
It needs blood?
DeJesus...It's got him.
What's wrong?
I ought to smack your face!
What on earth's the matter with you?
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
How is he?
Sixpack...
Who were you talking to?
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
What is it?
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Let's hope it holds.
Clear for pickup.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Hardly.
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Bitch!  Look what you did!
Right.
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Your pocket?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
