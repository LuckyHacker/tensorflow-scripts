Everybody knows about--
He <u>has</u> to know...
We went through the door...
We followed your instructions.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Lock.
By name.
Where?
Where're we taking him?
And heavy...
He sure is big, Jack...
We can handle it.
Not at all!
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Barrel.
Shock.
Experiments?
He's conducting experiments of his own.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
He stayed a long time.
Uh-huh.
I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
Can't you make other creations?
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Why not?
No.
Taste it.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Taste it.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Good.  I'm hungry.
Coming...
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
Just what?
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
I know.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
I can't help it.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I know.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
Yes.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Yes.
For this.
Yes.
No!
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
<i>                      Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Specifically.
We're here!  You sent for us!
