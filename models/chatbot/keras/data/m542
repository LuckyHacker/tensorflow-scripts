She'll be fine.
Are you okay?
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Hostages?
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Anybody been hurt?
Yeah. I'll check.
Jimmy, how's the -
Everything on it.
Everything on it?
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
You do?
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
I'll try to remember that . . .
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Lois, I really don't see why --
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
I like worrying about you.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Lois, someday --
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
What else could I do?
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
"They?"
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
You're not selfish at all.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
I'm sorry.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Never closed my eyes.
Sleep well?
Oh, hi.
Hi.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Let's get you inside . . . .
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Say you love me.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.
I want to.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
I'm listening.
We'd better talk.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I didn't think I wanted to.
Maybe you wanted to.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I was right. you are Superman.
Lois, I . . .
It's true. It's true.
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Oh Clark, no!
What??
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
How could you win a crazy bet like --
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Who ????
Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Where were you?
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Lois, you're amazing.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
A "complimentary corsage."
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
In July???
It is kinda romantic.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Really?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Be my guest.
Maybe I could try --
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Actually, yes.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
I do?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
I don't?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Uh. . .
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Lois, what are you doing?
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Lois, I usually do.
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
Gee. But --
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
What??
Does she know about it? She's in it!
Does Lois know about this yet?
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
But . . ..that's terrible!
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Uh...home...
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Good. My heart can't take it.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
I like trees.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Mush!  Mush!
North!
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
A parka.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
You'll have to pack quickly.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
What else is ballast for?
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
It's beautiful.
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Why didn't you go before we left?
Wrong.
It has everything.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
I'll be alright.
Genius!  --  Lex.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
This way Lex.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
What's a curl?
I think he said a "curl."
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Artemis? Do you read me?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Yes.
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
I asked the right question.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
No possibility for parole?
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
Sensible enough.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
My kind of people.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
Now This I want to hear.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.

Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Shhhhhhh!
Oh! That black box in our cell?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
To ski?
Why?
North.
Where?
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
DELETE IN CUTTING
 DELETE IN CUTTING
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
Australia.
What do you want?
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
We will bring him to his knees!
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
He has powers as we do . . .
Constantly.
He flies as well, then . . .
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
So --  I hope you like it.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
You must be freezing.
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Superman! The --
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Put down Lex Luthor?
Put down Lex Luthor !
North. Keep going North!
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Cuba.
What more?
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
He ran in fear from us . . .
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Who is this . . . Superman?
Zod.  Zod.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
It will. Starting with your own.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
We must combine our strength.
General --- ?
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
He's captured Non!
Sentimental idiot.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Yes?
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
You are master of all you survey.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Look, they need a machine to fly.
Stay. I will come to you.
What shall we do now?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
And I will lead.
		DELETE IN CUTTING
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
