Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Scale the --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Dignan, I --
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
What?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
Dignan, I --
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
How?
No. I'm not.
You're kidding.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
He stole a tractor.
What's he in for?
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
So how is it in there? 
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Does it float?
Behind Bob's house.
Where?
Oh, I'd say about --
How big is it?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
You're living on a sailboat?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
We're not sure.
Why?
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
You think Applejack knew?
The grandfather clock?
Pretty much everything.
What'd he get?
I'm not kidding.
You got to be kidding me.
Yeah.
He did?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Like amnesia.
I don't think so.
Dignan, it's too late.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
There's not enough time.
I'll get him.
What are you talking about?
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
Come on.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
You're kidding.
Come on, Kumar.
Wait for Kumar.
Let's go. Come on.
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
I don't know.
Where's Kumar?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Who tripped the alarm?
Careful. Check his pulse.
Help me move him.
Get against the wall!
Nobody move!
Freeze!
Applejack! What's happening?
It's going back down.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
What's happening? What's going on?
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
I don't know.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Good. It's supposed to be.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Any activity?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
OK. Roger.
Take your second position.
Uh-huh?
Hang on a second.
We all set?
Roger.
You're all clear.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
So do I.
Yes. I do.
Yeah. As a girl.
As a person?
Do you like Inez?
He was all right.
He was a nice guy.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
I don't think you will.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Did that hurt?
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Next week we'll be drinking pi√±a coladas.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
I did.
OK. Mark that down.
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
I'm sorry, Bob.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Shit, Dignan.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
Get out of the way.
He doesn't want to fight.
Bob!
Dignan. Take it easy.
He seems pretty good.
What do you think?
Let me feel that.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Right now.
What time did he say to be here?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Who's Mr. Henry?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What is it?
I want you to look at this.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
Sure.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Who's in the car?
Ah. Couple days ago.
When'd you get back?
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
Shut up!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
I know that. But --
That's what she is!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
She needed it.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
$383.
How much?
I had to give some to Inez.
Where's the rest?
I know.
Sixteen dollars.
That's not correct.
We've got sixteen dollars.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Our money situation is not good.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
I'm not. But there's --
Don't panic, Anthony.
I think we better go home.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
You don't know how to hotwire.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Shh.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
She doesn't need to know.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
I don't think we can do that.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
What?
I have an idea for that.
We need a car.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Would of been nice.
I wish I'd been there.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
OK.
Why don't you come with us.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
If you say so.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
He told you and you let him do it.
You were asleep.
Where was I?
This morning.
When'd he tell you?
That's a long time to be in jail.
We said 48 hours.
He went back for his brother.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
Maybe he just went to the store.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Right here.
Where was it parked?
He's gone. He stole the car.
Yes... It's true.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
This was in fourth grade.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
See, now we've got a plan.
Bob?
Obviously. That's a given.
As long as he gets out OK.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
He needs to hire an attorney.
No kidding.
She's from Cuba.
On the left.
Which one was that?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
They don't?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
What. What's the matter?
What the fuck is going on here?
Sure.
May I have a word with you, please?
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Inez, this is --
Hi.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
No. We didn't.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
True.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Bob?
You owe me fifty bucks.
On your marks...  Get set go.
OK. Go ahead.
I'll say it.
I'll just say it.
You were spoiled rotten.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
What about them?
Look at the treads on those.
Yes, they are.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
See if mine are in there.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
I keep it for emergencies.
Well, then cut it in half.
I don't want to use it.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Why not?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Can I get that credit card from you?
Don't even say it, man.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
What do you think?
What's wrong with him?
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Yeah.
Like he meant it.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
What about what that guy said?
We got it. We got it.
Holy shit.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Is that the manager?
We know there's another stocker.
There's another stocker, right?
Where's the other stocker?
Where's the manager?
You're right. You're right.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Dignan! Stop!
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Dignan, calm down.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Nothing. Go ahead.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
You think we're going to be chased?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Just turn right here.
Loop around real fast.
Yeah.
Is it back in?
Hang on a second.
But he didn't say anything.
That's not bad.
Eight dollars.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Yeah, I heard that.
It had an alarm.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
That sets it off.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I'm lookout.
Yeah, I saw it.
Did you see that?
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
How was I ridiculing you?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Where are you going?
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
What do you think the cops have?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
She's an attractive older woman.
She's really kind of hot.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
Would they do that?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
No. This is he.
This is he?
He says. This is he.
What does Starsky say?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Why?
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Dignan, it's --
OK. That's wrong.
Right. The blond guy.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
What color hair does he have?
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Why'd you want to help us?
Absolutely.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
We're renegades from despair.
It's an esoteric journey.
Yeah.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
This is good.
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
No. Bob did.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Death.
Exactly. Woah.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Are you afraid?
I don't want to die.
No, that door over there.
Me?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
That sounds like Dignan.
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
How'd he do?
Yes, he did.
Did Dignan take the test?
It feels good.
How does that feel?
Take a deep breath.
That was a test?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
What do you mean?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Hold it.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
So do I.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
You mean a safecracker?
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
You mean like techniques?
Grammar.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Thanks.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Thanks.
That's a sharp jacket.
Nice to meet you.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Temporarily.
It's in the driveway.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Who's got the car keys?
Yeah.
I didn't do anything.
Jesus, Bob.
No.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
What are you doing?
Sure.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Nothing. I was just asking.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
You OK, Bob?
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Give him a second.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
It was stupid.
Let's not even talk about it.
Jesus Christ! No.
Was Future Man adopted?
No. I wasn't adopted.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Why do you say that?
Were you adopted, Bob?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Sixty days?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
No, I don't mind.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You think I'm improving?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Why not?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Bob, where you going?
Is that OK?
What?
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Anthony, I --
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
How long are they going to hold him?
He looked too shaken-up.
You think he got my license plates?
OK, Dad.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Nobody does.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Move.
Where you going?
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
I hope not.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
There's a million places to hide around here.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
What was that?
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
See you, Bob.
See you.
Yeah. He said that.
Are you serious?
Let them fight.
Let them fight.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Could you grow cinnamon?
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Hector woudn't do anything.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Did you ever steal a car before?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Who?
Future Man.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
Like silk?
What?  What?
God, yes. Like silk.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Cuba.
Were you born in Mexico?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
No.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Dies y nueve.
How do you say nineteen?
Where were you?
The front stairs.
Where'd they come from?
Feel this.
What do you mean?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
I hear you're a good thief.
Yeah.
You're Anthony?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Bob! Get back in position!
What?
True.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Wait. Did he see us?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
What's he doing here?
Yeah.
That's your friend Anthony?
That's Anthony.
Wait a second.
Is that him?
Is that Buckethead?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
The one and only Little Richard.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
I don't know about that.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
You're the faggot.
Are you a fag?
Now!
Wait a second --
Here we go.
Hold on --
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Do they let you --
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Do you have your own cell?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own room?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
What's that?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Run. Run. Let's go.
Applejack drove.
He's stuck between two floors.
Where's Applejack?
The elevator broke.
Take him to the car, Bob.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I think so.
Is he breathing?
Let's go!
He's having a heart attack or something.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
I couldn't hear anything.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Everything OK?
Yeah?
Scarecrow?
Jesus Christ.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Come on, Bob.
Look. We want you on the job.
That's OK.
That's OK.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I didn't have any choice.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Come on!
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Bullshit.
Bob, you're lying!
I never agreed to that.
You said 48 hours!
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Yeah. It is.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not bad.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Anthony. Bad news.
Dignan.
Let's go.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
What's his name?
Just get in the car, Bob.
What is it?
Yes, I do.
You don't even know his name.
I know it's not.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
I can't do that, Bob.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Watch me.
Not in that car you're not.
I'm going back.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Come on, Dignan.
This could be a trap.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
What do you mean get back?
We'll have to see when we get back.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
I don't know.
How long has he been in there?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
That could be anybody's.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
The weed.
What are you talking about?
My brother's in jail.
You can go first, Bob.
See you in a little while.
Bob. Are you coming?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
What the fuck possessed you?
It's registered in my mother's name.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
I don't know.
Is he chasing us?
He wouldn't move.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
There were more than that.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
So it's my fault?
I told you they were there.
Way to go, Bob!
Bob, I've got nightmares.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
I don't want to talk about it.
Bob, will you please listen?
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
You really think he'll remember you?
No. I was calm.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Don't count it.
How much is there?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Did we get it?
That's good. Keep it at forty.
This is natural.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
What happened?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
What are you doing?
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
That's too bad.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
His name was Swifty?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
He electrocuted someone?
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
God DAMMIT.
I paid for it.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
Bob.
OK.
That's your domain.
That's my responsibility.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Let's just go.
I think we might of scared her.
Maybe she turned.
Where'd she go?
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I warned you, Dignan.
The guy is fucking insane.
I told you he's crazy.
What did I say?
I can't believe you said that.
What was that all about?
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
Good question.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
I'll just drive my car.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
It's true, Dignan.
OK, Bob.
Yes. I did.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Can you use a coaster.
What are you talking about, Bob?
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
Let's cut the bullshit.
That never would of --
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
My brother.
So who's going to know?
They are.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
No.
Not even for emergencies?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Well, what do you think?
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I might have mentioned it.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
I'm working on it.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
He said you ran away from home.
He said what?
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
I'm trying.
You keeping out of trouble?
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
How you doing, Bob?
Did you hear that?
Ground defense.
Hand to hand combat?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
And what does that cover?
26 weeks.
How long do you have to go?
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Well, I think --
Why?
Yes.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
We're just going over a few things.
Join the party, fellas.
He's damn good.
Is he good?
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Oh, yeah.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
The grammar?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
What do you mean grammar?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Is he in?
This is no good.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
What can we do?
Can't get it. It won't... 
What's the story?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Why did he go that way? 
Who? Applejack?
Where did he go?
You got that?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Where?
Well, I left some money in there.
He left his sweater.
Where's that guy going?
We're closed, sir.
No, it's not.
It's locked.
Come on in!
Mr. Henry?
How's the weather down there?
Right.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
You Hoto?
No. Just pool.
Fight. You know.
What?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
She is a good looking woman.
I don't know.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
Got a little lucky.
You a good pool player.
Sure.
You like Chicanos?
She Chicano, yes?
No, my friend knows her.
Is that your chiquita?
No. I just have short hair.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
What?
The world needs dreamers, son.
Good to know you, John.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
