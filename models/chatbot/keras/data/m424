You bet.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Hello, L.A.
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Thirty-five bucks.
How much?
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Yeah?
Yeah.  It's French.
Mister D'Amour?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Thanks, Billy.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
Hokey enough for you?
Knew what?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Maybe they're not tricks.
A Nix specialty?
Take a look at this.
doorway) And who's that?
That's Butterfield...
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
Nope.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
I love weird.
My life was too weird for her.
Why?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
You ever been married?
You heard right.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
It'll be something hokey.
How?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
Who is he?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Nix?
Nix.
Who?
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
They go together.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
That's so cool.
Right.
Isn't that French for something?
Right.
D'Amour.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
How'd you spell that again?
All right.  It was...
Who did this?
I told you --
Who did this?
Deep shit?
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Beats me.
Why would I do that?
You did.  Didn't you?
It's an illusion.
What about death?
Death.
About?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
He won't.
I don't want him getting in the way.
No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
He's a priest?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
I know him.  I saw him.
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
It's him... it's him.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
If you've lied to me to me --
Not yet.
Anything?
You'll do more.than that.
I'll tell you.
I don't know.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
Don't.
I could scoop them out.
Please.
Maybe he'll show you.
What is he?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Why did you wait so long?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
It was me.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
He's with us... He's with us...
He's with us...
Be ready.
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
Yes.
And are you afraid?
Yes.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
Out!  Out!
Harry-?
What the fuck?
I think so.
Is it finished?
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Harry?
I... have... to.
Don't look.
Yes.
...yes?
I'm here, Harry.
... oh... God...
Harry...
No!  No!  No!
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
You can't.
I've got to help him.
Hang on!
Oh God!
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Harry?
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Are you all right?
It's okay.
What was that?
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Yes.
And they all came...
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Are you sure?
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
I was so afraid.
Nothing you don't want.
Nothing?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I'm here, aren't I?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
It's okay.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
What then?
I wasn't.
You said you weren't with him for love.
No.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
I told you --
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
Some or it.
He taught all this to Swann?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Stuff?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
He was the real thing, right?
It was more than that, I think.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Oh Christ.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
What did you find?
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Yes.  You do that.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
That's my business. Harry.
So why did you marry him?
You didn't marry him for love.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Why?  Because he had you?
They were jealous of him.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
How did it go today?
Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
I can be very persuasive.
They won't tell you anything.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I don't know where you'd start.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Are they treating you okay?
You haven't seen anything yet.
He's good.
Sure.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Do you?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
When do you want me to start?
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
I'm no bodyguard.
Harry.
Harry.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Where do I sign?
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Sorry.  You asked.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
You don't believe me.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Does that mean...?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
And you don't ask questions?
He's a secretive man.
Why not?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
What's the connection?
I think we make our own futures.
You don't?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
Did your husband know Quaid?
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
What about me?
I left three messages already.
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
No word from D'Amour?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
You saw this?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Valentin?
No.  I'm not going near him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
I just saw him.
Oh God.
Somebody killed him.
Sure.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
... they believe you.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Bad show last night?
No.  Not yet...
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Are you finished with me?
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
--vanished.
And this Butterfield guy--
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
He got up and walked.
Where the fuck is he?
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
What makes you so sure?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
What were you doing up there?
Fuck you.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
With what?
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
I'd like to hear them.
Oh, I've got plenty.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
I heard he was the best.
They weren't worth a damn.
What about Swann's miracles?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
So could you walk on water?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
Trickery and divinity.
Heaven and Hell?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
You believe that?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
What about?
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Don't bother.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Him too.
Help me.
Shit...
D'Amour --
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
I want to see Swann face to face.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Was that Swann's idea?
I tried to pay you off.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Yes.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Yes.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
No.
Are you satisfied now?
Shut up!
Leave her alone --
You want more money, is that it?
Yeah, I know.
I can't let you in.
When will she be in?
I'm afraid she's not in.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
No.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I like to know why things happen.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
A ticket home,
What for?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
Why'd you come here?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Swann's wife.
Who is she?
Are you a believer, then?
Are you sure?
I don't think the dead much care.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Probably.
Any movie stars buried here?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
What's the difference?
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Are you a gambling man?
I saw him in Vegas once.
You know of him?
Philip Swann?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
Maybe I just bought it.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Mine.
Whose is the car?
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
I'm here to offer you a job.
Then what do you want?
We've never met.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
What are you, my mother?
It's one in the afternoon.
Go away.
Mr. D'Amour?
Shit.
And what does Jennifer think's real?
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
Does anybody?
She has no real grip on reality.
What's her problem?
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
I won't say anything.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
A Mister Quaid?
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Who is he?
Yes...
The Puritan?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Hold on.
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
Not much.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Yeah.  You could say that.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
What?
My God.
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
You need an ambulance.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
Have you been in?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Are they all in the business?
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Well... nobody.
For an introduction.
For what?
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Sure.  Vivovich.
You know Vinovich?
Not the Walter Wilder?
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
Harry D'Amour.
At birth.  I don't know you --
That.
What?
Where'd you learn that?
Try.
I don't know.
Can you do it?
Yes?
He did something with the ground.
I can't... I can't go any further...
You didn't try hard enough.
This is where we killed him.
Fuck.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
In my time, and nobody else's.
That's where we're all going.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
Nobody's better off this wav!
He's better off this way.
... no...
Looks that way.
They got here before us.
Jesus!
Yes.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
No.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
And you believed him?
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Is that all?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
And he didn't have them?
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
And you're not?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Is that all?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Didn't know you read minds.
You think I'm an asshole.
Will that do?  No?
Oh Jeez.
Help me.
I don't know what else to do.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
It's me betrayed him.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Oh yeah?
I did it for Dorothea.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
He deserved it.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
How the fuck do you do that?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Look, Ma, no wires.
They'll never find out.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
Who is she?
What?
One question.
A couple of weeks.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Call me tomorrow.
I got to go.  I'm late.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
And he's dead?
Yes! Yes!
Is he the Puritan?
Nix! Nix!
Who's not?
He's not!  He's not!
Swann?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
What is?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
Why's that?
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
What about Philip Swann?
Maybe... I... don't...
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
No.
Have we met before?
Liar!
No!
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Yes.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yes.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
Not true.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Why would I want to?
You could still help me do that.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
And?
Binding you.
Swann?  What are you doing?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
No!
You don't think I've got it to give?
Fuck you.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
