Wade did a little reminiscing.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Wade's here.
Yeah?
I want this bastard brought down.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
I can smell it.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Technothugs?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Kimberly!
I think he wants more than your cookies.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I'd think about it.
What did you say?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Put that on your political resume.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Speak up.
Your mother.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Funny guy.
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
My man Dubbs.
Avon Lady!
Who is it?
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
I don't want to hear anymore.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
You're crazy.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
What are you talking about?
That wasn't your plan, was it?
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
We have to talk.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Not anymore.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
I'm wasting time.
Where?
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Remember my promise.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
And I want Doucet.
I want to stop aging.
Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
I'm not voting for you.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I'll be alright.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
Out of the room.
Hello Wade.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
You're working a partner on this.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
When you bring in Doucet.
Give it to me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
Mug sheets.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
What's this?
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What the hell are you talking about?
Sir, your transmission's fading.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
Kill him... kill him.
He could be brought back.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Just great.
Telephone repairman.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Shut up!  Drop it.
Sir---
Keep 'em busy.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Aces.
How do I look?
You okay?
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Sir, your limo's here.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
Fine.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Ooops, I forgot.
Not the 'T' word.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
Go in the house.
Nobody's looking.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
You sure?  I can help you.
I got it.  I got it.
Need help?
And you should be with your family.
You should be in hospital.
No you don't.
No.  I want to be with you.
I'm signing off.
You be careful.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
I just heard.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
Hospital food.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
You okay?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Yeah.
Not yet.
...Have you been drinking?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
...What are you talking about...?
You treat her nice.
I'm here.
Sanchez...?
We're partners, aren't we?
What's this?
Not too good.
How do I look?
How ya feeling?
Rip Van Winkle.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Simulated one.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
What else did he get?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
No, sir.
You're not pregnant, are you?
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
Wanna try?
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Then find me some cigarettes.
Yes, sir.
You want to be a good detective?
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Hey, I'm eating.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Good night.
Good night, Wade.
I'll be okay.
You need anything else?
Thanks.
She's pretty.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Yeah.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
What's this place?
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Married?
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
I was set up.
Why?
Drop it.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
How then?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Hey, buddy...
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
Yes.
Can I ask you something?
Pass.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
My insurance won't cover it.
Wanna come?
I'm not fond of television comedies.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
I'll inform dispatch.
Some things never change.
How do you know?
They're going to rob that bank.
Technothugs.
See those guys?
Doucet killed my partner.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
Lean year for role models.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Does it drive itself, too?
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
But Sergeant...
I'm ready.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
I drive.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Yes.
Are you a cop?
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
You my partner?
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
They always are.
But he was such a good cop.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
Take a look at this.
You never want to find out.
What's it mean?
Demolition Man.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Bye.  Thanks.
Good to know you, Willy.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
What's your name?
I'm going to be a policeman.
My granddad was a policeman.
Yes.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
Seat's too high.
Yeah.
You all right?
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
You could always take it off.
This little thing says I can't.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
Hi.
Hi.
