You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
Meurice--
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Sort of...
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Abby...
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Well I do...
No, I--
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Abby. What's the matter?
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
Thanks, Meurice.
It won't?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
I am?
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
I think someone's watching.
...So?
With your gun?...
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
What do you want to know?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
Isn't that what you want?
...You leaving?
In the trunk.
...Where is everything?
All right...
...What's going on with you two?
Marty.
...Who?
...What was that?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
I don't know what you're talking about.
...That's what's important.
What the hell happened, Ray?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
Ray--
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Well... what happened?
Yeah.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...What do you mean?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
Yeah.
...You called me this morning.
Yeah...
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Why didn't you get into bed?
I said you're bad.
...What?
You're bad.
...Ray?
Abby--
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
I don't know. I better get off now.
...You all right?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Ray?... What time is it?
Abby... you all right?
Hello?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
...You ever get tired?
When you don't they're usually nice.
...Mm-hmm.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Thanks.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
What'd he say?
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Uh-huh.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Yeah? What happened?
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
I couldn't believe it either...
...Well I'll be damned.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
...Huh?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
You wouldn't be putting me out.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... the couch would be all right...
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
On the phone. Was it for you?
What?
Who was it?
I just gotta see a guy.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
See a guy.
Where... where you going?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
...Drive me to a motel?
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Your husband.
What was that?
Yeah.
...Ray?
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
I own the place.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
We don't seem to be communicating--
It'll pass.
Going out with Meurice.
...So what're you doing tonight?
About ten years.
So how long have you know Meurice?
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
I don't follow baseball.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
Thanks.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Remy.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
Ever durned one.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Sure don't.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
He needs a room, Dusty.
Lubbock?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...Friday?
What night is it?
What?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Yeah.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Sign.
Back where?
...What was that back there?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
What's the matter?
No.
...You know that car?
...Hell.
Well now you do.
See, I never knew that.
I told you. I like you.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
Yeah...
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Uh-huh.
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
You owe me for two weeks.
Then what'd you come here for?
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
What "what"?
Nah, I trust ya.
...Count it if you want.
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
...it's too damn risky.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Nobody knows you hired me?
Of course.
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
...What did you do with the bodies?
So it would seem.
Dead, huh?
Got something to show me first?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
...What kind of fish?
Yeah...
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah. Is it...
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
...What?
I want you to go fishing.
...There's a big--
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
For the money.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
You're an idiot.
What do you think?
Well what?
I didn't say that.  Well?
You want me to kill 'em.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
It's not strictly legal.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
Got a job for you.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
...Anything else?
No. It just made them feel better.
Now that don't make much sense.
Most of the night...
How long did you watch her?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
...Just doin' my job.
What do you mean...
What did you take these for?
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Meurice...
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
What's the point?
That's not the point.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
This.
What.
What's this?
Right.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
Right.
Don't throw that out.
What.
Pour that back.
Right. Sorry.
Red Label.
You said the usual--
What's this?
I don't know, didn't he call?
How would I know?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Has Ray come in yet?
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
What's that?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
...Why?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Got a problem, Meurice?
For what?
Thanks Meurice.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
Is Marty here?
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Howdy stranger.
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
What?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Tuesday.
What day is it today, Angie?
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Where was I?
