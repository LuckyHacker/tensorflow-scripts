Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
What are you talking about?
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
It's not the gas, Dad!
Help me with this thing!
No.  Upstairs.
Oh, come on Dad...
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Just out for a while.
Where are you going?
Who's Lisa?
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Don't be a smart ass.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
It's getting there.
You got your room straightened out yet?
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Ken!
Come back here!
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Oh, please...
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
He'll die with me!
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
I'll kill you now.
He's dead, you bitch.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
Where's Jesse?
Wanna join your little friend?
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Jesse, help!
It's happening again.
What?
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
You're fucked in the head.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Are you nuts or something?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry...
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
Shut up, Grady.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Only the wet ones.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
No shit.
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Who told you to choke up that way?
It was okay.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
What the hell are you talking about?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Yeah, why?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
So, you live around here.
Naw. Just killing time.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You two got a thing going, or what?
What about it?
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
Get outa here.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
What's so funny?
Hi.
Hi.
I can't!
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Who, Jesse?
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
I killed him!  I killed him!
Jesse, God - what happened?
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
Why won't you talk to me?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
There's nothing to figure out.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
I'm not hungry.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
You want to talk about it?
yeah, I had a bad night.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
Oh, Jesse...
It's gone now.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
What is it?
Whoa!
What is it - What's wrong?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Yeah?
I'll get over it.
About not finding any bogey men?
About what?
Disappointed?
Uh-uh.  Wait...
Anything?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
I feel like a jerk.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
C'mon, cut it out.
Any ghosts in here?
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
What do you mean?
So, you feeling anything?
What's this?
Here.
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
What is this place?
It's a surprise.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Make a left at this corner.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
What's all this.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
I don't know.
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
Who?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Are you sure?
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Are you okay.
Wow...
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
Traumas of a ten-year old.
I think it's sad...
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
You know her?
Yeah?
I figured you might like some help.
I know.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
Yeah.
You mean a shithead.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Let me look at your eye...
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You okay?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Ah, nothing.
How come?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Fine.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Morning.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Sure...go ahead.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
No.  I'm okay.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Making friends?
Okay, I guess.
So, school going alright?
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
You okay?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Eggs?
Huh?
Jess?
'Morning, honey.
'Morning.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Yor dad picking the music again?
All of them.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Hi, Kerry.
Hi, guys.
Thanks, Mom.
We're going up to bed now.
We're going to bed.
You're going out?
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
What's that?
Okay...thanks.
There's a Jesse on the phone.
