Why?
The point was to love each other.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Why?
I don't know any other way, Annie.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I don't care! We'd be together.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
One more time.
Annie!
Show me again.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
I won't ask you to.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
What?!
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Tom.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Huh?
You missed a button.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
I am comfortable.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Everything under control?
How did you find out all that?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
Ever think of moving there full time?
It is. It's lovely.
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Why didn't it work out?
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
How did you meet her?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Son?
Five years. My son was born here.
How long did you live here with your wife?
OK.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Yeah.
Feel good?
Thanks.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
OK. I'll stop talking then.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Poor thing.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
The answer's no.
I can handle it!
Need a lift?
Shit.
You too.
Enjoy the day.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
She did?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
He's beautiful.
Oh yes. I forgot.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
I have a way with animals.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
You sleeping all right in that house?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
A jogger, huh?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Just who's been laughing at who here?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
When I was first married.
You lived in Chicago?
Does Chicago count?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
What's that to miss?
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
What?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
It is cocktail hour yet?
You okay?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
That's up to Pilgrim.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Doesn't matter.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
All by yourself?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
This is Annie MacLean.
Go ahead...
Great!
Hi.
Good.
How's everything?
So do you.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Tom's gone.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Let's bring your bags inside.
Sure.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Who is it?
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
What?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Why should they?
That's not true.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
What?... Oh baby...
Who's going to want me now?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
When? Tonight?
My period.
Started what?
I said... I started.
What did you say?
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Yeah, you know everything!!
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Tom?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
What are you talking about?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Well...  So you tried riding again?
About what?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Did you go riding?
Nothing.
Thanks, honey.
I'll take care of it.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
You're right. Good.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Well, one was for salad...
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
I'll come.
No. I just thought... forget it.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
You got everything you need?
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Did he mention it?
You already did.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Hi.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
I think they call it a pasture.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
I didn't see it.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Don't they believe in signs here?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Little.
You buckled up?  You cold?
No, you just act like you do.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Then why do you want to leave?
That's not true!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Did he tell you that?
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
I don't believe this!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
What?
How long is this going to go on?
You were never thirteen, Mom.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Would you like to see that?
You don't.
I didn't know I had to.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Fine.
Fine!
Whatever you want.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
I don't care.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
What?
Maybe they should put me down too.
Yeah?
Mom?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
What about him?
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Doesn't matter.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
No, you didn't.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
It's still early. What's your next class?
Fine!
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Okay.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Why don't you go lie down?
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
All right. Speak to you then.
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Exactly...
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Yes. We're suing.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Who's there?
David?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Where to?
You want to take a walk with me?
I have so much to tell you.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Was the trip okay?
Tubab means white man.
What do you mean?
No. I am a "tubab."
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Yes?
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
I don't understa-
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
What do you mean?
Take your time.
Yeah, what?
May I have a suggestion?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Let's not talk about that now.
How are you feeling about work?
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You're allergic to hay.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
About what?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
I wish I did.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Huh-huh. You?
Everything all right.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Night.
Good night.
I know. We miss you too.
I miss you, Annie.
Okay.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
When are you coming home?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Well, it's good that you're there.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
She will if you think she should.
What if she doesn't want to go?
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
I'm not pretending anything!
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Why?!
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
You've already made arrangements!?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
What was I saying?
No.
What did he say?
Yeah.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
Why did you go?
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
How was the dinner?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
Doing what?
You've got to stop doing that?
Do you? Do you really?
I love you.
Aw... that's so sweet.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
How's my pregnant chick!
Sing it to me, Frankie!
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
Okay.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
The funeral's on Friday.
We're very lucky.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
No, let me go.
I should go get some of her things.
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
What did he say?
Tch. What are you --
I'm sorry.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
That bag's almost empty.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
What about Grace?
Yeah. Bye.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
Riding with Judith.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
I should be in by two.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Hi.
Hi.
It's me.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
What choice!!?
No. He had the choice.
It's so cruel.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Oh, I don't know...
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
You too, Diane.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Promise.
Promise?
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Oh, how sweet.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
What?
Yes, it does.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Frank's a good man.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
You don't seem to upset?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
They fired you?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
I'd love to go there one time...
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
What was it like?
I was there for that shot, actually.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
No reason you should, no reason you should.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I'll help you with the coffee.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
She calls him Tommy...
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Where does this go, Diane?
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
Of course not.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
- See, what you can do for him --...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Well, of course, right...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Diane!
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
You!
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
What?
Mixed salad.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
No thanks.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
Ain't brain surgery.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Ha...
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Weekend after next...
When you figure on branding?
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
That's what some folks say.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
He thought it was a ghost.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
We should be fine, then.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Yeah.
Tom?
You know her?
I don't believe it.
You know, you're a good kid.
I wouldn't let happen.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Of course I have.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Why do you always wear that hat?
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Don't you go to school?
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
No!
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
Grace, I need you to come with me.
I want to watch.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
What does that mean?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
Sure.
Sure?
There's no hurry. Take you time.
I can't... not yet...
I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
I know where he goes.
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
Are you afraid of anything?
That must have been pretty special.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
I don't know if I can.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
I don't have all day.
I can't...
It's never too soon to start.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Can you drive?
You're catching on.
That's not a question, is it?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Isn't it like, obvious?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Mmm. An editor.
She's an editor.
What does she do?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
She gonna be long?
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Yeah?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Jude, you okay?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
"... and I said that"...
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
Do you want to go around by the old road?
I just could never say it!
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
So?
I thought your mom's coming up?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
It's warmer than I thought.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
I know. Amazing.
Did you notice -- no cane?
I want to see Pilgrim.
What, sweetheart?
NO!
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Maybe... look -- just...
You want to watch some television?
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
OK, OK.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
How's Pilgrim doing?
No, not yet.
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
You shut up, stupid!
You just showing off for her!
Don't be such a baby!
WAS SO!
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
IT WAS MY TURN!
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
I understand...
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
How much longer do you think?
We still have a way to go.
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Oh yeah...
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Honey... I was always good.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Sometimes.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
You ever miss it?
Long enough.
How long were you married?
What are you looking at, young man?
The number's by the phone.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
You're looking fit.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Hey, darlin'.
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
What do you mean?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
What stuff is that?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Well, that'll happen.
