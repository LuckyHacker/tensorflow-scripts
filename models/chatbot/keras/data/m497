The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
OK. Say what it is.
Shut up!
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
What is your name?
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Lee!  It's him!
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
And that, of course, would be me.
They asked for the best street man I had.
Feds asked for me?
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Good job.
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
I know, but --
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Sir, I can explain.
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
So was I.
He was just doing his job.
Tell me about it.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
This is pathetic.
He stole my wheel!
Carter.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
Oh, I think you like this very much.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
What a surprise!
You know him?
Oh my god. Griffin.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
The art.
What?
Oh no.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
What are you doing here?
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
I'm sorry, Lee.
I'm sorry.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Oh no, I dropped it.
Oh yes.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
No, please, I don't --
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Like that.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
I am from outa town.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
What do you hear?
This concrete?  This is still America.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
Going into the restaurant.
Which one?
It's him.
What?!
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Excuse me?
No, fish is a PM food.
Want some?
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
Are you OK?
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Good God, ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Yee-aww.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Yes, I think so.
That's not how it goes.
Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
You know War?
Yes, I know this song.
Now, that's American music.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
You want more?
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
Yeah, it's good.
You like it?
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
It happens.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Come on!
You talk too fast.
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
Stool pigeon.
What?
Stooly.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Don't go there...
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
No. I just made it up.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
He was trying to kill me, not you.
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Did you make the plate?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
No.
The license!  You get it?!
What plate?
You make the plate?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
Shortcut?
I know a shortcut.
What about them?
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Right....
It was not my intent --
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Witnesses.
Where were we?
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
I was being polite.
That silly-ass look on your face.
What?
-- what the hell is that?
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
We are both full of shit.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
It's the same thing!
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
A little.
You speak English!
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
No.
You have one of these?
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
Help me Rhonda.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Beach Boy.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
You talk very fast.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
How about a lift home?
Not to me. Never to me.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
You OK?
It's okay. For restaurants.
You don't like it?
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
It's called a dress.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Jesus...what do you want?
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
They put you in charge?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
How'd what go?
I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
What's wrong with that?
I could get promoted right out of here.
No...what?
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
The Feds?!
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Oh, baby, you cruel...
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
You're killin' me here.
Where'd you get it?
Not anymore.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
What?!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Hmmmm?
That's what you were supposed to be!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Yo, Johnson...
Carter, shut up!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
What kind of assignment is that?
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
I'm talking about the girl.
He is the situation.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
How much they want?
At this point we don't have much.
Any demands yet?
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Where do we find him?
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You sonuvabitch.
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
What are you talking about?
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Do it!
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
What are you talking about?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
Nobody touches me.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
Or somethin'.
You a cop or something?
Shut up!
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
I want to speak with my daughter!
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Hello.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Yes.
Can I speak with her?
She's fine.
My daughter.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Yes.
Ambassador Han.
Hello.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I do.
You have what I asked for?
Yes.
Griffin?  Where are you.
It's Griffin.
Yes.
Han?
Hello.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
I am so sorry about your men.
Carter, can I have a moment?
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
He is very good.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I would like one of my people to help.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
I will not have friends in America.
After I left?
I was trying to find the right time.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I still have work to do here.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
