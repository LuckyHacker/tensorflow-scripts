Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
They were over here, Professor.
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Is he serious??
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
See what??
I need to touch it to "see"...
Oh, right --
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
I'm lucky that way.
You were burned by some organic acid.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Red, I found something --
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
We don't take hints.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Don't get psychic with me.
You mean, outside... with her.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Story of my life.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
It doesn't say --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
-- Hound of resurrection?
See? I don't like that --
hound of resurrection --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
That's all for you, Sammy.
From where??!!
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
The freak in the gas mask --
Oh, I'll bet you have.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Three days too late for that one, "professor."
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Here. You'll need one of these.
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
You are a Catholic??
In private, if you don't mind...
What is it?
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
I think that is its hand.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
No. It was red. Bright red.
What the hell was that? An ape?
That makes him more than a hundred --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Do you believe in hell?
No. It's not.
It's almost over!!
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
He's just going through a phase --
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
I thought you liked being on TV.
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
It's her choice --  She's human --
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Is it bad?
Don't look! Turn around.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Me?? C'mon --
I worry about you.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Son. About Rasputin --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Reliquary --
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Who wards off demons.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
You're doing fine.
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Did he, now?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
How does he know so much about me?
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
We're on the move.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
Well, you did break out --
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
I don't want him.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Got tired of me?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Who's the squirt?
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Sir, may I go first??
His what??!!
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Who?!
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Grounded? Who's grounded?
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
I can live with that.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Anung-un-Rama...
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
She's dead.
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
That voice --
My job.
Thank you.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Yup.
You call that thing a cigar??
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
I'm in charge. We go back!
No. Don't --
-- should go back. Now!
Don't move. We --
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
I won't take 'em. They never work.
Each of us gets a belt.
Those things never work. Never.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
I wish I could be more gracious but --
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
What are you trying to say?
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
I knew those men better than you did --
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
How big can it be?
Alone?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Are you sure about this?
Good night.
Well good n-
Not from you.
Anything else you --
Not hungry.
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Shh! Just a second.
Where do you --
Hostage negotiations.
What was that??
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Hey. You: think twice --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
You want me to hold him down?
Could've fooled me. Go away.
No. I never was.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What took you so long?
Goodbye.
Yes?
Myers?
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Myers??? How's your arm?
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Helping you -- I just --
Oh-n-no -- I --
Whatcha looking at, John??
Father's back?  Still angry?
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
You're kidding --
...Polo.
Marco...
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Good.
I like that...
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Red, I --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Hi.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
No. Myers is taking me.
You're going alone?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Out? Out out?
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, then.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
You better have that looked at.
What?
Hit me.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
That you feel that way about me.
What -- ?
But it's not true, is it?
Coffee's warming me up.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
What about you?
I know.
He -- loves you.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
A brute.
Strong.
Cocky.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
He's just pushy.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
Doesn't sounds like him.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
Two steps back, please.
Pardon?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Yes, I --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Hello, I'm --
