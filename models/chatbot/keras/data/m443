Yes, Anatoly, yes.
To friends.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Come on!
You're right, of course.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
They'll kill me.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
Good idea.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
What kind of show.
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
But why tell us?
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Only four more cars.
What about him...?
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Okay!
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
S.O.P..
That's S.O.P..
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
So what do you suggest?
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
Yes.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Donít Jim.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
All ten million.
Satisfied?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
You knew about Jim?
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Krieger.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
May take a little time.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Always.
Is he serious?
I always have, Claire..
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Claire.
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire...Hey...
Ethan?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Is this the only way?
Okay...
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
What happened?
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
What are you going to do?
Bastard!
Kittridge...
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
We did what we had to do.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
I just need you to be safe.
You didn't have to.........
I didn't say that.
You don't think we're going to make it.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Sure...
May I come in?
What kind of help?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
You're sure about this?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Max made a deal with you?
I'm going to answer it.
The message is for Job.
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
What are you going to do?
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Who is they, who is they?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who is "they?"
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Where were you?
Take off your God damn coat!
What?
Take off your coat.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
You were in the car!
Don't move.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Roger that.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
Oh yeah?
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Sleeping's better.
Talking's good, walking's better.
I'm walking.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
We got it.  On your feet.
Did we get it?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
Certainly Ethan.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Kittridge.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
The arms dealer.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
I don't quite follow you.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
What?
Why was there another team?
Yes.  I see your point.
Who else is left?
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Yeah.  I follow you.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Yeah.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
One hour.
No sir.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Youíre in Prague?
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Yes.
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
I donít think so.
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
<u>Are you intact</u>?
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Are you damaged?
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Whoís dead?
Theyíre dead.
Go ahead.
Go secure.
This is Kittridge.
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Why don't you come back with me?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
About what?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
I'll get you close.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
What makes you trust me?
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
Profitable.
What kind?
Information.
What are we downloading?
I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
What about Job?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
I wouldn't dream of it.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
What was your deal with Job?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
Very good.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Mm - Hmmm...
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Why should I?
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Why, may I ask?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Like Job?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
It's quite out of the question.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
On what?
That depends.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Let's move!
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
What sector's the air conditioning?
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
That's not it.  That's not the list.
My contact is extremely shy.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
We're not outta here yet.
Merci.
Time up.
We'll see.
Zero body count.
In Langley.
Where exactly is it?
IMF mainframe.
Bank?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Give me a break, Pops.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
I didn't touch it.
Jack.  Jack.
Just don't chew it.
Give me the God damn gum.
Always.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Jack.
Claire.
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Jim we canít.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
The package is in the open.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Right, right.  Good.
Higher.
Higher.  Higher.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Very well.
I'm willing to take the chance.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
Then what am I doing here?
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
I thought I was going to see Max.
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
Why?
Would you remove your hat please?
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Jim, itís over.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Keep counting Claire.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
I knew about Jim.
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Good luck.
And get a doctor.
You got it.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
I usually am.
Youíre probably right.
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Jim...?
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Whatís going to make him do that?
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
How did Kittridge do it?..
Yeah.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
I remember..
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
- and picked us up in the States -
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Where are you?
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
Abort.  Thatís an order.
No.  Abort.
Can you lose him?
Iíve got a shadow.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
Sure.  If the main character does.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
He's our guy.
You're going to use Walter?
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
How was Chicago?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Why not?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
I guess.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
What problem?
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Tell you what?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Oh?  What's the problem?
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
I thought I'd take some now.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
And a lonely ass.
Such a nice ass.
I think I might just take that look.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Jack you're so wicked.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack...that's spying.
Why don't you take a look?
I don't know.
What's going on?
Loud and clear.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Of course I can hear you.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
Itís working.
Run it through from the top.
I always check the batteries.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Itís not working.
Try it again.
Connection denied.
Whatís the problem.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Yes...  Itís him.
Twenty minutes.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Thirty-two and change.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
