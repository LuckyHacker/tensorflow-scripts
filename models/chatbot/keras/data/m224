She is preparing a great abundance of food.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Tell me some other things about her.
Blonde.
What color hair will she have?
A woman.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Albert.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I want you to kill for me.
No.
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
NO! GOD, NO...
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
I want you.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
No... No, go away.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Bobby's got it.
Bobby...
We can do it right here.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Don't get funny with me again.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
The stuff we got last night.
What was?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
You killed Mike.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Here he comes.
Here he comes.
Don't be late.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
I'm nearly out.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Get lost Bobby.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
Out back in our morgue.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Yep, it sure is.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Can you tell me what their names were?
An old woman and her grandson.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
God damn, you people are confusing.
I am going over here.
Well, where are you going?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Thank you, Carl.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Is there a golf course around here?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Was there an argument?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Did she have someone with her?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
You try that you little monkey.
No you couldn't.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Oh.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
Smell something fishy, huh?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Okay, Gordon!!!
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
OK, Gordon.
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
OK, Gordon.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
Yes...
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
ALBERT?
Teresa Banks.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
What?
HE'S GONE.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Phillip?
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
What is it, Gordon?
No, sir, we did not.
And no one found the ring?
Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
Tell me about the letter.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
And neither will I.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Anything else?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Where am I? And how can I leave?
The later events have never been kept a secret.
That would indicate that it's the future.
Someone else has it now.
Where is the ring?
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Did she ever mention any friends?
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Any friends?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
He didn't suffer.
Sorry to hear it.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Where's Hap?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Thanks.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
What do you mean?
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
Thanks.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
No.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
What happened to her?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
Say no more.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
How come Jack let's you work here?
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Faulty wiring.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Yes, he is like a clown.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
She's wearing a ring.
Take a look at this.
I'll get my kit.
You better dust this place, Sam.
She must have known someone.
She lived alone.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
I think that's a good idea.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
It's late, Sam.
Agent Desmond, it's...
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
What is it?
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
Accidental?
Oh.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Cole said she was 17.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
I don't know, Sam.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
That's good.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
That's what I heard.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
It must be a high priority situation.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
I see. He does talk loud.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
A blue rose.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
What do you mean?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
How do you figure?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Shorthand. Really?
Sort of shorthand.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Cause I like it.
Why do you do it, Laura?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
But I love you, Laura.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
I can't help you there.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
WE got it back, that's all.
How did the car get back here?
What can I tell you?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
No.
You're not mad at me?
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
Laura, I am your friend.
No, you should forget about last night.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Not you, Donna, not you.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Nothing.
What are you doing?
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
Dancing.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Where are the Cookies?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Where are you going?
No, you're the muffin.
Goodbye, Muffin.
Donna, you are a muffin.
You want a muffin?
If I can smoke it.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
No, I want to smoke.
Do you want to talk?
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Of course...
Donna, are you my best friend?
Laura?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Call me.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
Well, why not?
Oh god, Laura.
Maybe.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Are you going to see James tonight?
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
I don't know what to do.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
He probably wanted to drive over.
The usual, 9:15.
When?
James called me last night looking for you.
Thanks.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Noooo...
You didn't do your homework?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
I did? I didn't see anything.
You missed somethin', Ed.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Nice night.
I haven't got it yet.
You got it.
Fill 'er up.
What'll it be?
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
Oh, yes... yes...
No... No...
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
What does Bob say?
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
Maybe.
The pages are gone. That's real.
But Bob isn't real.
Bob.
Who would do that?
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Send me a kiss.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
I already made you two tapes.
Did you make me a tape?
I'm not.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Let's go all the way.
We're on our way, Baby.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Right on time, baby.
But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
What? She asked about my father?
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
And what a muffin you have.
I am The Muffin.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Hey, Jacques...
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
See what?
You want to see...
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Bobby killed a guy.
What?
When he finds out.
What?
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
You mean the ones you pity.
You always hurt the ones you love.
"Oh, Laura..."
Oh, Laura.
Everything, but everything.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You know it and I know it.
What do you mean?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
What's going on?
I can't tonight.
What about tonight?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
This afternoon?
Not now.
I've got to see you.
When am I going to see you?
James...
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
How can I be together if I'm not together?
We were supposed to be together.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
It does matter. We're in love.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
Why? It does.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Laura, do you love me?
Okay.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
James...
They were looking for wood.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
Trees?
You're getting warmer.
Sex?
You'd think so.
Eating?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Boating?
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
We throw away the whole head.
I understand.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Fish eyes?
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night, Mom.
It's a school night... back by nine.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Where's Dad?
Sure you do, it's good for you.
I hate asparagus.
Mom, take it easy.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Mom... what are you wearing?
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
What were you doing in my room?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
What?
Laura.
I forgot my books at school.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Can I take the car?
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Stay away from me.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
I was down the street.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
No.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Yes.
Dad?
Yes.
Are you sure you're okay?
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
We're late to get to your mother.
No.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
A special friend?
A friend from school.
Who was that?
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
Dad...
Let me see.
Not really.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
...school's fine...
School?
Fine.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Dad.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Bobby didn't give you this?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Did you get this from your lover?
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Leland...
Look at this finger here.
Leland, what are you doing?
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Oh, Leland.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Nothing, I chickened out.
What's wrong?
That's right.
I don't know.
Who am I?
What are you doing?
I can arrange that. I like that.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
When's the next business trip, big fella?
What did you say?
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
As if I didn't know.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Come back as soon as you can.
Norma, are you alright?
There's no one here.
You're right. There's no one here.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
