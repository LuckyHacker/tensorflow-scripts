Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
What're you talking about, George?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Then what's the problem?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Don't you like her?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
I thought you were in a good mood.
No.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I don't know, I think...
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Chicken salad.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
You're in a good mood today, George.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
What are you talking about?
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
-- is that what this is all about?
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
-- is that right?
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
That's okay too.
We cannot go into this later.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
Lester.
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
I just thought you'd like to know --
What do you expect me to do about it?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
That's George.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
That you were just indulging me.
What?
Yes, but... I thought...
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
Why?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
That kid... the hairdresser.
Who?
Do you think George is a fairy?
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
And who's Jill?
She's a friend of Jill's.
She what?
Well she...
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Right now, I just don't care.
But aren't you...
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Hello, George.
Hi.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
No, I know.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I hope she's all right.
-- Anyway.
I don't know. Just a minute...
Is she all right?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
What about?
Yes.
Your husband?
Why don't you see Lester?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
What about?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
Whatever you say.
What're you doing later?
You're looking great, baby.
I can see that.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
What kind of treatment?
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
George --
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
What?
Nummers.
-- What?
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
Calm down, baby.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
I don't care.
But you don't know what happened.
I don't want to talk about it...
I gotta talk to you.
You're late, George.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll be back in a while.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
Wow.
It turned out to be cancer.
She did?
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
I know.
Gee, that's very serious...
I don't know.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Yeah, I think so.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
She's got a...
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
What?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Why not?
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Thanks a lot.
You mean that girl, don't you?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
My keys.
What're you looking for?
No.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
Hello.
Shit.
God, I adore you.
Okay.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
I guess so.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
I guess so.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
It isn't?
Then it's not your problem.
No.
Are you?
Her?
Are you in love with her?
No.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Like what?
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Let it ring.
Want me to?
Uh-uh.
You going to answer it?
Nobody can hear it.
That headboard.
... what?...
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Right now?
Yeah.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
I am not!
You are.
I am not!
You are.
I am not like my mother!
That you're just like your mother.
Then what do you think?
No.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Yeah...
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Yeah.
You think that's funny, don't you?
No shit.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
No kidding.
I never get my hair done.
Yeah, it is.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
What?
Don't make conversation with me.
... just, you could look very heavy...
Why?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Making it with my mother?
Am I what?
Well, are you?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
I asked you first.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Gee, this is great.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
... yeah.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
Yeah.
Did you hear me?
No thanks.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
No thanks.
Chopped liver?
I do her hair, yeah.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
No thanks.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
A little.
Hungry?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Yeah.
You here to see my mother?
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
What sort of references do you have?
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
I guess not...
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
They are?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Well, yeah... you know.
You do know what money's like these days.
Right, that's right.
And you need money?
Right.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Great.
I went to school with her husband.
She is.
Wonderful woman.
Great.
How is she?
Right.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
You are today.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
You do it.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
What!
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
You're late, George.
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
Oh fuck, Norman!
You promised you'd do the show.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Yes, Buffums.
Buffums?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Yeah.
George!
I don't know -- I've got to.
What for?
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
Don't leave me...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't go, Jackie...
God, there's Lester...
What?
I don't know... Jackie?
What's that supposed to mean?
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
It's too late...
So I'm saying it...
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
Well then what are you trying to do-
No --
You're going to kill me.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
-- It's Malone's.
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Look about last night --
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Where are you going?
Lester's on his way.
Why?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
I've got to leave?
-- you've got to leave.
-- good afternoon --
-- well you better go after her.
-- Jesus --
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
Why?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- we are?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- do you want ice?
What's wrong?
Not me, pal.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- yes, you --
Me?
Look who's talking.
-- ass and legs --
Mmmm --
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
-- mmm --
-- very nice, very nice.
Nothing.
-- what?
-- oh I thought you were --
-- where'd you go?
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- sure.
We're friends.
Am I entertaining you?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- yeah.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
What are you looking at?
He never stopped.
He still having parties?
Sammy's?
Where do you want to go?
I am you, you little bastard.
That sounds like me.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
You were great.
You don't think so? I do.
No you didn't.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You were great.
I don't know what gets into me.
-- what?
-- gee...
Fuckin' A --
-- you are.
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
Jackie, can we --
-- don't you want to --
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
-- we can't now.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Don't do it.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
What about it?
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
He's a director.
-- this guy with Jill.
-- what guy?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
Look, either come in or stay out!
Sit down!
What are you talking about?
Sit down.
Don't, don't, don't...
I know... you don't know, I know.
It'll ruin everything.
I don't want to... I swear...
No! Don't! Please!
You're a genius.
Yeah, baby...
George...
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You did, I know you did.
Baby...
You did, didn't you?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Yeah?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Hey, I don't tell.
You know what I'm talking about.
Did I what?
Did you?
What?
George... how about Felicia?
I won't screw you up.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
I just have to do one little thing.
George...
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
Did Lester know about him?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
It was after you, baby. After you.
Did you?
And what?
And?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Why not?
Why not?
No.
Do you? You still see him?
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
The shrink? Many times.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Yeah... wow.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
It's hot in here.
What's wrong?
Whew.
... I don't get it done often.
Yeah... I mean great.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Great.
Jill's coming with us.
Okay.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
No, I'm sure.
You don't seem very sure.
Yeah, I think so...
You would?
I'd cut it...
Well, what do you think?
Can't you do it out here?
Probably the bathroom.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, I do.
No, thanks.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
You going to tell him?
-- Well no. It never came up.
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
He's a very private person, actually.
I'm sure.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
How long you had this?
Great... so how's everything with you?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
I don't know. Probably not.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Jesus...
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
So how's Norman?
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
I'm busy, man.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Yeah?...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Oh yeah?
Wanda...
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
What?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
No, man.
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- took a bus.
-- how did you get here?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- why did you come in today?
-- you know better...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- Otis?
Otis is dead.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
I don't know if you don't know --
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- Oh my yes.
-- White ladies?
But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- Oh yeah.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
What with?
Wash her.
Yeah!
Okay... thanks...
Not yet.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
-- yes, George.
-- yeah, this is --
Jackie Shawn.
Okay!
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Call me!
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Hi, George.
Hey, stop by the shop.
I have to see you.
That's too bad.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
I said you were a loser!
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What did you say?
Yes, yes, I did.
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Please!... that's not like you.
Did you?
George...
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
-- yes.
That's all you've got to say?
I wish you'd go now.
Does it make you happy?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
What? What? What? What? What?
Jesus.
... well I'm glad you told me.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
How?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
-- please, baby --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
Baby, don't do this --
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Baby, please don't... I love you.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
What difference does it make?
I just want to know, that's all.
What do you wanna know for?
How many?
Obviously.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
Where did this come from?
-- and take this with you.
I'd like you to leave now.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Yes.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Yes.
That was him.
Oh, Christ.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Let go of me.
Didn't you, baby?
I'm very tired, George.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
What is.
Well that's something.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
How come you took your own car?
I do, Jill.
Bullshit.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I don't want to fight, George.
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
-- well aren't you --
-- go ahead.
I've got to get her out of here.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Now, Jackie --
Commercials.
Television or movies?
Ha, ha.
What does he direct besides traffic?
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
I know, honey.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
Look at the way I live.
What business meeting?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Never mind. Where've you been?
Who?
A friend dropped me off.
Where's your car?
Jill says nothing.
... Okay...
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
What?
Neither do I, baby.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
When is that?
When I get off work.
When?
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
Right now?
I want your feelings about it.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Your advice!
What do you want?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
No, but I think they might.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Egypt.
Going where?
Whether or not I'm going.
About what?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
When can I talk to you?
Yeah, baby.
George.
Okay.
I already said hello.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
George.
Great... can we talk later?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Egypt!
Go where?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Yeah.
Could I?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Could I talk to you for a second?
Great.
How did it go at the bank?
Yeah, baby...
Hello.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Great.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
George.
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
What!
George?
Okay...  Night, baby.
Yeah.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
You've never even been around one.
Of course I like children.
Maybe you don't even like children.
-- Sure.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
We live together now.
Will we live together?
Why am I great?
Yeah, baby.
Honey?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Do you really mean that?
Yeah.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
You're different.
What about me?
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
Honey, what happened?
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
How?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
What?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Fine. How are you?
How are you, baby?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Now, George --
Keep moving --
George --
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
George, I don't --
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
No shit?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
You said somebody... who?
I just... who what?
Who?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
What?
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
Well, like what?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Here in the canyon.
Where?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
What're you talking about?
There were some shots.
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Said what!
But Mr. Norman said --
You need a cut.
No?
No.
-- A wash and set.
What're you here for?
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
What?
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
I'm finished with her.
Yes I do.
You really think so?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
No --
She's nothing but a whore.
Lester, it just happened.
I mean, how did that happen?
What about her?
What about Jackie?
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
Oh yeah...
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Me!
Who?
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
I'll have to wash one out.
I know.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Okay, thanks.
Have a drink.
No thanks.
Want a drink?
Well, I don't know.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
I wanna hear it from you!
Didn't they tell you?
Did they have something against me?
What, do you think I planned it?
Was it me, did you have something against me?
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
What can I say!
I wanna hear about it.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I wanna hear about it, George.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it.
I said sit down!
But...
Sit down.
Now wait a minute...
Godammit, George...
Well, what?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
What do they look like?...
Well... who are those guys?
All night.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
You live like a pig.
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
Layered?
This really ought to be layered...
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Isn't that bad for it?
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Well anyway...
See she doesn't drink too much.
-- yeah?
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
I don't know what to...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Oh, hey...
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
... this doing hair it's...
I know it, I know it.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
What about, tonight?
... she's very upset...
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
Sorry, honey, I...
I know what you mean.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Oh yeah?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Okay.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
Tonight?
When?
When?
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Oh yeah.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Sure.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
You're right.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
They're not?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Thank you.
It's good you want to do something, George.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
But what?
In a way. But...
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
Yes it is.
It's an unusual trade.
I see.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Thank you.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Well, yeah.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Okay, okay...

I'll call you back...
Come on by.
I'll call you back.
Awww --
No.

No.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.

Wasn't sure it was you.
What took you so long?
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.

Okay.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
What do you mean?
No you won't.
I'll call you back.
I'm coming over.
Yeah.
You're home.
Somebody's mother.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
I was too old.
And?
A daytime soap opera.
A soap?
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Yes.
You do?
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Sid.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Well maybe I can get you something.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
-- you phony asshole --
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Jackie Shawn.
You know what's wrong.
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Does she know about us?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Who are they?
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Because I don't want one.
Why not?
No.
Aren't you going to have one?
Here.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
They get hair all over the place.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
I'd like a drink.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Fine.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
You're still jealous.
What's that?
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
You and your touchy investors.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
That's not very logical, Lester.
Of course not.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
Then you were talking to him.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Steve?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Who do you think I was talking to?
Who were you talking to?
I am?
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
No kidding? Your own shop?
George is going to open a shop.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Is that right?
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Anyway, you're crazy.
See you later.
Fine.
I'll call you.
That's right.
Oh yeah?
Poster-Kleiser.
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Jackie, what're you doing?
Hi, Leonard.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
What did you do?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
... Mmm-hmmm.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
-- uhh-huhh...
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- Yesss?
Well, there was this one time --
C'mon.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
What?
Honey?
I would say so, yes.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
He does?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
What?
Jackie --
How much?
I'm exaggerating.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well, you know what I mean.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Five times a day?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
-- Yeah, honey...
But you have problems?
We don't think marriage is important.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well, it's George.
It must be something.
Nothing.
Well, what is it, honey?
-- No. No really.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Don't be silly.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
I guess not.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
George is great but I know what you mean.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
I know, I'm sorry.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
So what's your point?
Well, he is.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I am? I mean why?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
Who is that?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- he'll never know the difference.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
What's wrong?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
You're kidding.
You're going.
You're going?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Of course not.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
-- why?
Let's do that.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
-- oh I don't know --
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
That bastard.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
I don't think so.
George? Was he alone?
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
Well... sure...
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Not with your hairdresser.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
He's a hairdresser.
Good for you.
-- no.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- never mind.
I'm terribly sorry.
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
Johnny!
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Sort of.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Is he an enemy?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Sure.
Oh. thank you.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
But why Egypt?
That's right.
Egypt?
-- just wonderful.
Thank you.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
-- yes, Jill.
Jill.
Jill.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
That's fine --
-- there's not much room --
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- I'll get in the back --
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- what's the problem, honey?
Thanks for coming by.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
John...
No!
No.
Do you have something against traveling?
No.
Are you married?
No.
Do you have children?
No, it's not that...
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Three weeks.
No... how long did you say?
You seem disappointed.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Where to, Les?
Call me Les.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Everything okay, son?
-- we're going to be here all night.
No of course not.
Everybody but us.
Have they sat down?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
