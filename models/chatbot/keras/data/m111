Now you gotta be careful.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
You're clean.
Yes!
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Were they wearing condoms?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
With how many people?
Yes.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes. Altogether.
Umm. Altogether?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
17.
How old you?
Hold up man.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Why not? You stink.
Nah.
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
You are?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Yeah probably.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Fifteen for me.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
I don't know. How much do you want?
How much you gonna take?
Shut the fuck up.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Yeah.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Good luck?
So really, it's good luck.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Shut up.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Right.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
So.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
What are you talking about?
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Why I give pennies?
That.
Why I do what?
I don't understand why you do that.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Bet.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I know what you mean.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.
Yeah.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
Yeah.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Darcy?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Oh. You like her?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Who?
I wanna fuck Darcy.
He looks like my uncle.
Man, this guy is really good.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
I hate this game.
Yeah me too nigga.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Yep.
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Can you do it man?
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Right.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
The cartoon?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Unzip my pack, yo.
You down with the boost?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You got any money?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You thirsty?
They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
Yep.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
It's no big deal, right?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
It is right.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Why?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Did she suck your dick?
Yeah.
Telly.
Den less go Joe.
78th.
He lives on 76th?
Probably.
You think?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think he's got any herb?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
What for? That guys a dick.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
Are you hungry?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
What do you want?
Shit.
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
What do you mean?
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
To what? Virgins?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
Yeah.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
Yeah.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Right.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
How?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
What?
You know what else?
Let me smell it again.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Oh man, that's the best.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Yeah.
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
How long did you fuck her?
Did what take?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
She can fuck?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Well, how was it?
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
You fucked it?
What do you think?
Was up bitch?
Shit.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Casper, where is he?
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper, where's Telly.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper.
Yeah. Do it again.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Yeah me too.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Man we fucked him up.
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
You sure?
Na.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
I had a female vagina last night.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yeah.
You goin'?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Where you goin' tonight?
Right here.
Where you at?
Nothen' B.
Casper! Was up kid?
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Sup. Sup.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Sup then? Sup?
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
What?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Of course I do.
Do you care about me?
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Nothing?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
But I'm scared Telly.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
How do you know?
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I'm nervous.
I like you too.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Come on.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Uh huh.
Yes.
Do you like kissing me?
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
Yeah?
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Tonight?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Yeah. I can understand that.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
She won't? Why not?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
You were?
I was lookin' for you all day today.
Yeah.
At the block party?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
You have?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
Is it cold?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Hold on.
Yeah. Come on.
Right now?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Hey.
Here. Swallow.
No...
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
No, Fidget, I...
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Bang up stuff.
What is it?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Who are they?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Of course I do.
Do you care about me?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
I wouldn't believe it?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Why is that?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Because your a virgin?
Because, you know why. You know.
Why?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
What do I want to do?
Yeah.
You know what I want to do?
I guess so.
Telly is at Steven's?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Come dance.
What?
Dance!
But I only had sex with Telly.
I'm sorry.
I tested positive?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
What?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
No.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Were you protected?
One.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
15.
How old are you?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Your a real philosopher.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Yeah?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
Thanks.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Yeah?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Am I getting warm?
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah, I guess so.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Everything is wrong.
Miss, would I be prying?
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Sorry.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah.
You're OK?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
What?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Hello.
No. I just gotta go find him.
I'm coming.
I gotta find him.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I only did it once and...
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Good luck.
Wish me luck.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
I hate sucking dick!
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Mine?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Passion...
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
No, I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
I didn't bleed.
Did you bleed?
I know.
You are being ripped open.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
You still mad at him?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Telly says was up.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Who, Benny's little sister?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Do you know where he went?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
What happened?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah?
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Whah is dissdee?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Whah?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Yep.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Yep.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
Yeah.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
Yeah I get bored.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yep.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Oh shit.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
It's like...
Yeah.
Sweet.
Making love is like.
Yep.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
What?!
No. I was just kidding.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Yep.
Oh god. That's horrible.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
No.
You've heard the stories right?
Yeah?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
I hate 'em.
He still does.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
You think so?
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
All right.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
When are you gonna be back?
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Shh.
Mom.
That's right.
But then I won't need your money.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Hi mom.
Yep.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Where does everyone sleep?
I don't know, eight or nine.
So, how many people live here now?
Nah.
You want a wip-it?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
What are you guys doing?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
Yeah.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
It was... it was.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
To come?
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Yeah.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Right.
It's very monotonous.
Yeah.
It's grandmother style.
Slow.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
OK.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
I can't man.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
What man? What is it?
