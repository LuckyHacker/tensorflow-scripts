Don't lie to me!!!!
I don't know what you're -
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Dwayne listen to me -
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
I can't get enough of it.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I want to get some hounds down here.
Damn.
None of them had any --
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
What the hell happened here?
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
Sort of!
Rock solid.
And you're solid on that?
Uh huh.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
It's NOT too late!
It's too late...
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
What are you talking about?
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
Dwayne's dead.
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
He killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
He killed her...he killed her...
Oh Jesus...
Then Sally comes too.
That's right.
We've got to go now, then.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
No we're not.
Then we're screwed.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
Do you have everything?
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
It's gonna be o.k.
You killed him...
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
There it is...now what about the others?
Here it is.
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
How long is it going to take?!
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
Not bad enough to kill him.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
You're crazy.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Well what are we supposed to do?
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Neither do I.
No.
You think he's bluffing?
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You're out of your mind.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
You said that last time!
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
He's going to be trouble.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
And how do you figure we do that?
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
He would have done it to us, right?
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
That's not what I mean.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I can't do that.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I don't know...
What are you thinking?
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
It's the right thing to do.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I don't know...
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
That's not what I mean.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I...I can't do that.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
I don't know...
What are you thinking?
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He saw everything!
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
What are you gonna do?
Shhh!
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
What's that?
I've got one condition.
I don't know.
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
Torch it?!
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
All right we will.
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
Maybe.  Who cares?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
At the expense of six people.
That's right!
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
Because...I know.
What makes you so sure?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
We'll figure something out.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Why?
It won't work.
Hell, it won't be us!
Well someone's gonna find them.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
We don't know that.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
No.  We can't.
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
What do you mean what are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
Shit, more than that.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Ten thousand right here.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
What the hell...
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
Oh, you would have done great.
Never heard of it.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Cash and what?
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Seven thousand...
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
I hear you.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Don't spend it all in one place.
Sure thing, and --
Ready to roll, partner?
What are you doing, Earl?
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Whoa, Earl!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
No.  It's not.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
Just take it in stride.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
None of us like it!
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
I want my share. All of it.
What are you proposing?
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
By Friday.
Two thousand...
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
How much?
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Well, I don't know...
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
I'm all ears.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
What's your offer, Jesse?
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
My point, well...
Why don't you get to the point.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Yeah?  So?
Denning was wearing a bug.
What's that?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Because someone may have gotten away.
No.  Why?
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Hello.
How are ya?
You know I do.
Sally, do you love me?
I swear to you, it's true...
I don't believe it.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Yeah, it is...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't know.  My friends...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Why does that bother you?
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
I don't know, Booth.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
How are we going to do all this?
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
A satellite dish?
I love you.
I love you Sally.
So do I.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
I know.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Great...
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
How the hell did he find it?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
You're worth every last penny.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
And I'd take it out on him.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
That son of a bitch.
He's not, he's...
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
Nothing happened?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
You deserve it is the occasion.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
I'm in here.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
I love you too.
OK.  I love you.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Yeah I'm fine.
Are you sure you're OK?
OK.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing.
What's wrong?
I know.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Yeah.
Heard you had quite a night.
Hi.
Hi.
I might have to look into that...
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
No.  But he would, probably.
Has he?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
He's irresponsible.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
What for?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Thanks for your time.
A week ago, at most.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Could it have been this?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
What did he buy?
Yeah, I've seen him.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
And what's that?
I have a better plan.
What?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
You said that, I didn't.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
Sounds like you don't trust me.
Yeah.
Test the product?
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
What do you think about all this?
This just might be our ticket!
I don't know.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
What makes you say that?
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Why?
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Did you say After Midnight?
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Dwayne.
Sheriff Hogan --
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Have you known this all along?
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Mm-hmm...
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Don't you have to be here?
Maybe I should come along.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Why would someone do that?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
What are you getting at?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Uh, no...
We appreciate that.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
I guess we can get started.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Lingerie...
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Yeah.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Is this marked money, or what?
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
A lot of men come in here?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Sure.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
C?
Uh...C?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Oh.
No, I can't say that I have.
Shopping here?
Have I seen her?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Hmmm...
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Well I don't know...
Anything...specific?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything I can help you with?
Hi.
Hello.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Something wrong, Jesse?
Well I'm here now.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Yeah...see you at three.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
So be here at three.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
About what?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Why?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Yeah whaddya want?.
Jesse?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
She's not his type.
Sort of.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Take it or leave it.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Damn its hot in here...
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Just goes to show you.
Calm down --
Dwayne please calm down!
You'd do this to me!
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me?!
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Dwayne put the gun down --
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
It certainly is...
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Whatever...
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
I didn't say that.  You did.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
That hasn't stopped you before.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Watch that.  Watch that tone.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
What are you saying?
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
It was going to be a surprise!
Forget it.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
What?
Hey where's the hot pad?
I don't know...
What's this?
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Don't hurt me.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
We're gonna talk.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I think I am.
You're never getting that much.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Well you can't have it.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Listen -
Well you're not getting, either.
I'm not asking.
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
What?
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
Right behind you.
We're out of here.
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
I'll settle for a third of that.
Then what the hell are you all about?
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Absolutely positively.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Well I don't know --
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Don't you want it?
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
This whole place?
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
That's great Earl!
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
And what happened?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
You do?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Are you hungry?
At least around here it does.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Did they ever find out who they were?
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
How's work?
Yeah.
Is that the mail?
I was in the neighborhood.
I didn't know you were coming.
Hi.
Hi ma.
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
I'm not getting an answer.
This isn't right...
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Yeah.
We're going to find out.
You think he skipped town?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
So someone did get away.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
So...what's the good news?
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Not in the trunk.
There was more than that.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Money.
Anything in it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Give me the bad news.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
