Yeah.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.

My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Yeah.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
Ooh.
I feel faint.
Oh, oh!
Oh!
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
That's bullshit.
No.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
...us.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...-tiatin'.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
 Yeah.
I think so too.
Patriotism is its own reward.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Us.  Owes us.
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
You.
Hello.
You, Arlo.
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Who put the big hurt on...
Who had to put a gun to your head?
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who drove the ice cream...
You did help a little.
Always the negative...
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Stop limpin' around like that.

Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
We're the shit.  Bigtime.

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

 Well.
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!





Why'd you stay behind?!
What'd you come back for?!
Look out.


Okay.  Come on, big guy!
They'll meet you at the top.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Go.
Let's go!
Hang on, hang on.

Sorry.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold this. 
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
 There's gotta be...
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?

 Vitelli! Vitelli!
...-ta get outta here!
We got-...



It's working.
What?
 
What?
 
Come on.  Come on.

Oh.

All right 


It's melting, man.
What?
Mason.
 It says forty- nine.
Forty-nine point four.
 What's it say? 
Shoot me. 
 
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
I'm gonna kill him.
Stupid.
You've gotta be...
What the--?
What the hell?
What do you think I'm doin'?!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Tunnel.
...tunnel!
...here comes the...
Okay...
He's comin' up fast!
...our ass!
And Brynner's right on...
...they come!
Here...
We've got Elvis!
  I've got the real thing!
We!
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Forty-five seven!
Oh, fuck!
Okay.  Okay.
...-ful?!
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...

...on!
Hang...

Stop.

Go!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
You got Elvis?!
What?
...to him. 
 That's why I didn't give it...
...-natic.

You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...

Go, go, go! 
Come here.

Okay, here we go.
Come on, come on!

Okay. 


 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 

Arlo!

Okay. 

 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 

Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.

 Okay.
Yeah.
 Okay.
Oh.
 Come on!

Reach into my pocket.
Arlo!  Arlo.
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

What?
Put your hand in my pants.

Hey, hey, hey.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
Hey, just shut up.

They're movin'.
Huh?
They're takin' off.
Hey!

Listen, Arlo.
No. 
Are you all right?


Ow!  

Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
You all right?

Bring him down!
 
Yeah, I know, I know.
...man.
A-And you  owe me...
...or my conscience.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...deal with this asshole.
I think you oughta cut a...
Yeah.
Hey.   Mason.
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Yeah, baby!
 Whoo!
That is loud!  I'm 

Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.

...miles.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...split.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
...shit.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...-er.  It was your friend...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
I mean, if that gun was...
Not completely, anyway.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
...shit.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
Listen, Arlo...

We got two paddles.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
...hospital.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Robert Del Rio?
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
How wonderful for you.
We were nationally  ranked.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
You know.
 Yeah.
So I took his truck, yeah.
...truck.
So you took his...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
...overdrawn bank accounts.
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
You know what I'm sayin'?
It won't even start half the time.
...piece of shit was worth.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...stole the truck.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...-tion?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
You're fucked, man.
...did you?
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...

Worth a try.
Okay.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
What?
Uh-oh.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!




 All right.  Hey.



Oh, no!
Oh, no!
No!
Oh, shit!


Okay.  Okay.
Keep still.


Oh, shit.
Come on!
What?
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
...here!
Then stay...
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!

You're--?  What?!
Taking it down the hill.

I'm crazy?
He's crazy!
...man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
I'm a dangerous man!
...you're dealin' with!
...to him!  You don't know who...
 Listen!  Listen...
Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 

All right, let's go.

 Aw, shit  
...yeah.
Yeah...
These'll keep it cold.
 Okay.  Okay. 
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.

Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
Come on.
No.  Shit.

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!


 Go, go.
 Go on.
 Shit. 



Hey!
Hang on!
 

 ...shit!
...ho!
 Oh...
Ho, ho...

Shut up!
 Gee, you think so?
 Okay.  That didn't work.
Holy--!
Gee, you think so?
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
What the fuck was that?!
You okay?
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
 I made it.
I made it!
Whoo!
Whoo!
All right, you got it, you got it!
...you crazy bastard.
Come on...
Come on.
Come on.

...Pete.  Come on.
Come on, old...
...wanna give it a try!
...Night Shift, but you might...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
I know the likeli-...
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...Pete!  Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Come on.
Get over!  Get over!
Left, left, left!
...easy, easy, easy.
 Oh...
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
God, man!
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
Oh, shit.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
Goddamn!

Okay. 
 Okay.
Oh, shit.


That's right.  Now,  move!
Oh, shit.
...do we?
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!

Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
...we can make it.
I think...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
...Shift.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
Oh, shit.

Fuck! 
All right, you got it.
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
Come on, old...

...up!
Back up!  Back...
Oh, shit.
...man!
Holy shit...
Oh!


Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
...waiting!
Well, then, that means it's call...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...truck!
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
 
I did not steal the truck.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
...let live.
 Yeah...
...I believe in live and...
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
You wanna hit me?
...you.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...-er!
...-cho and a hijack-...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...I'm not the psycho.
 No...
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.

Kiss my ass!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...gun?!
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...

 Nice job back there.
Okay.
    Elvis is on ice again.

Okay!  All right!
All right.
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
Oh...




Oh, shit.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
...-ed.
...work!  It's not even load-...
Doesn't...
What?
Doesn't work.
Take your gun!

Shut up.
You're nuts, goin' back there!




Okay. 
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Ah, one of them's in the back.
Okay, okay! 
...-damn!
God-...
 
Fine. 
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Hey.

 Shut up.
I ain't playin' that.
...fine.
That's...
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
...the ice cream for money!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
You stole this truck! That's...
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck!
You stole this truck.
Yeah, borrowed!
Borrowed.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Am I missing somethin' here?
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
...-er.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
...-er.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No cell.
Oh, man.
We're clear.

...town. 
You'd better coast through...

Do you wanna give me a minute?
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
...-ed.
 Excuse me...
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...all the time.
It happens to this piece of shit...
What the hell's goin' on?
Damn.
Come on!

Are you kiddin'?
...up.
Shut...
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Come on, get in the truck.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
That dog ain't mean.
That dog was mean before I met him.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 

Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
Would you hurry up, please?
Go on.
You are not takin' my truck!
I need your truck!
...doing?!
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
All right, then how about this?
No.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I got, uh....
I got, like, uh....
You want cash?
You want cash?
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.

All right.
Peace.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
And if that Elvis shit...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
...-er.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...truck.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
I need your help.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
For cryin' out loud.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...ya?
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...-tana.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...and a shitload of ice.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...

I need your truck.
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
What did I say?
 No.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
Hang on.  Hang on.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Why don't I--?
Oh.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Huh?
That'll make up the difference, huh?
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...and fair...
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
He could've called first.
Except for the fact that I need cash.
Uh, huh?
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
...moron.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Well, he told me to collect cash.

Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

Since today.  New policy.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since when does...
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
No argument there.
That's my business.
Art.
Great. 
Freezer in the back.
Where do you want this stuff?
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Where's Sam?
...-ty.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Oh...
A little early for a delivery.


Hey!
Vaughn.
...such is the price...of patriotism.
But...
And it won't be pleasant. 



Three seconds.  One...
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Well, well, well.
...without compunction.
This country trained me to kill...
I urge you to be persuasive.
Oh, my God.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
Listen, shithead!

Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
What'd he say?
It's for you.
...within five minutes.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
I'll keep an eye out.
...about him.
We're worried...
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

That was quick.
Be cool.  Be--
Hey, be cool.
Hey.
 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!
...help you?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
I did what I could for you...
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
So...where's my truck?
Well, that just about figures for today.
  Hey, actually...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You-You can't let him...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.

...here.   Mason... 
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
I had no idea how powerful it was.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
We do need your truck.
...take my sorry old truck.
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
Mason, you have to take this...
Yeah, that's my truck.
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
He's the dude...
Listen, deputy.
What the hell's a sage?
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.

No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
...-lem too?
You got a prob-...
I'd say we're about even.
...including the permanently extreme.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
However, you are also non-en-...
Exactly.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Us.  Owe us. 
...owe you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Thank you.
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Hold it!
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
We've got it...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
What?  Say again...


Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Whoo-hoo! 

Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!





If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Any of them Richard Long?
They were all wearing hardware.
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
Is it--?
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Forget about him.

Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
So far, ye-yes.
And let me guess.  You failed.
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
All right.  After they put you away...
Almost quaint.
"Went away."  I like that.
Went away? 
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...always done, Richard?
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Mm-hm.
Grateful?
...and the government.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...that.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...-ple.
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
You look fit...healthy...
You look good, Richard.
No, go--
Is this stool taken?

There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
...about--
...I wish they would've let me say something...
Andrew...
It's too...
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
You'll kill us all!

No!
No!
...destroyer of worlds."
"I am become Death, the...
Let's proceed.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
You have my word on that.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Now listen to me.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...

If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?

This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...

I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
And I changed the schedule.

What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
...-tor Long.
Doc-...
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!
I'll do it.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
...here!
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I can't say it's a surprise.
Pleasant surprise.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Brynner.
...happen if I drop this?
Do you know what'll...
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?

All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
Closin' down, sir.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY.

INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.

INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Hit him again.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY

Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
Carl!  Set up the camera.

All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY.
Of which we have more than enough.

And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.

Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.

EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY.

Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on...
I'm on it.
Sir.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
What about these two?
...here!
I wanna patch in from...
Get your links set up!
Dennis!
Move!
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Shit.
Prep the launcher now.
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
...-ther orders?
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
...quick in and out.
This was supposed to be a...
Check the immediate area.
It's clean.
Check it out.
There.
We're in.
Vaughn.
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
That's right.
Richard Long.
...general store.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
You know the suspect?
Right.  Tim Mason.
...-ty.
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
It's a hundred degrees...
...gear?
Where's their protective...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...scientists.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...noon.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...screwup?
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
 But...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...-fall.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
They took that life away and left me with nothing.

I would've in another life.
You'd never understand!
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?









 ...checked. 
Dead, last time I...
Where's Elvis?!
No.







 
It won't be long, gentlemen.







Him first.
...-spite the mouth.
...and unharmed, de-...
Your fellow hero, untouched...

Bring him up.
Where's Arlo?
...-tainer!
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
...the river.
You try anything, it goes in...
I don't see my container.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
Hello.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...never done a thing for you?
...to die for a country that's...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
I want you to look at one another...
I don't know what the hell...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
Yeah?
Like I say, Doc Long's...
...should be right outside.
Odd, then, that his car...

...though.
Not tonight...
...time to time, yeah.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...Long.
Doc...
Assumptions are always dangerous.
I assume you have one.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
I beg your pardon?
...deer.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...dangerous.
Assumptions are always...
I assume you want that to go.
Iced coffee.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
....-lene.
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
Is this your establishment?
Mornin'.
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
 Two pots of coffee...
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
And don't give him any ice cream...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
Yeah?
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.
I can handle it.
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...-time,  remember?
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...it.
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Goddamn it, Ma-...

And you ain't gonna start now.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.

His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
Ah.
Secrets.
Uh, we both like to fish.
There's something else too.
...somehow. 
...he's smart enough to get you...
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
Oh, no?
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
Kabula's out.
Geneva just pulled the plug.

INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.

Negative.  Negative.
Is Elvis out?
Get ready to take it out!
 ...that tunnel.
Here's what I want you to do.
What's going on, colonel?

All right, let's move...
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
It's not over, Brynner.
He was Major Andrew Bryn-...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
After that re-...
And where are you going?

The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
It must've happened right after we left.
Thanks. 
All right.  Enough. Look...
...son.
That little geek is my...
It could be a cover, I suppose.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Run a check.  FBI, Interpol.
...-son.
A man named Tim Ma-...
Who's your suspect?
...-five.
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
...colonel?
What the hell are you talkin' about...
I will tell you what I...
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Uh-huh.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.

Excellent.
...-time. 
...try this one out some-...
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...

There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
Let me have those.
...that the prey can bite back.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
Yeah, I just....
Doctor.
...-m-means, Mason.  
 The only one who understands what this me-...
You're the only one I can trust.
Everything will die, Mason.
And what if it does?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
 ...or it'll ignite. 
The compound has to be kept cold...
 No...
Call an ambulance.

Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Mason.
Doc!

Some people might.
...fishin'.
...-to a simple thing like...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...is death.
...without caution...
...and that power...
...back...
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Tie a fly...
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...the master of his realm.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
He's brains without ambition...
...is a perfect hunter.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...like a fish.
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
My secret?
Been trying to figure out your secret.

What?
 ...miles. 
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
Dr.  Long!
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
How much longer for the range and power projections?
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?

Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
Yeah.
Mason.  Mason!
God!  They're gonna seal it.
...tunnel!
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Forty-seven.
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
I'm at mile marker...
...Mason?
Where are you now...
We've got the real thing!
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
...-son.
What?  Say again, Ma-...
Yeah, yeah...
...you, Mason?
Fol-...
All right, go.
Yeah, I'm sure.
You sure?
 
I'll lead 'em out.
  All right.
Jesus.
The Army, sealin' us in.
What the hell was that?

Don't move!
Just go check the temperature.
...tunnel now!
...we're all gonna die in this...
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...

What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...side!
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
...on the other end of this phone.
...there's a colonel...
 Listen, Pappas...
Now raise 'em!

...stole a truck under arrest.
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
I said let me see your hands now!
 Pappas!  Move the car!
...hands!
Let me see your...
Then how about if I call you "ass-...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...to talk, son.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...beer.
I didn't sell the boy any...
...public drunkenness....
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
Lying? 
That's not the way I...
...seriously.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
So you don't remember...
Got that?
...you answer mine.
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
You find yourself wearing a...
...-lem?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
Do you recognize this young man?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
