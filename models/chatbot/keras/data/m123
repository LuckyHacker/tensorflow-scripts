Sure, I'm okay.
I'm, okay... You okay?
Yeah.
Pete... You okay?
You okay?... What's wrong?
What?
You okay, man?
Pile in.
They're comin' with us.
What's happenin'?
No, I'm okay.
You want somethin'?
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Listen.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Okay.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Good... You up for a drive?
I don't think so.
You're not contagious are you?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Why not?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Why not?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
What do you mean by that?
I like to remember things my own way.
Yes, I thought my wife...
You're a musician?
This is our bedroom.
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Maid? Relative?
No.
No. Fred hates them.
Do you own a video camera?
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
What is?
Very strange.
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
What's that, Ed?
You know what I think?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Ours, Ed.
His or ours?
What a fuckin' job.
Yeah... Laurent.
You recognize that guy?
Yeah.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
Or not so recently?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Or something.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
As best we can.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Right... This just glided along.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Alice?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Where's the bathroom?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Alice...
Alice?
You killed him.
We killed him.
You all right?
Alice, I...
You got him.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Yes.
Are you my man?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Set.
Okay.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Okay...
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Yeah. Call him.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Andy?
So, should I call Andy?
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
You liked it.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
In pornos?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
How'd it happen, Alice?
Pete... Don't...
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Yeah.
Pornos.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What deal?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
You like it?
I used to.
Have you partied with him?
No... no.
We should stop seeing each other.
I don't know.
So what do we do?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
Are you positive he knows?
He'll kill us.
Okay.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Hello.
I'll call you again.
Me, too.
Pete?
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Sure.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Okay...
I can't see you tonight.
Hi.
It's me...
Hello.
Okay, baby.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Can I call you?
Me, too.
I want more.
Over there.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
I don't know.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Yeah, I remember.
I was here yesterday.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
I don't. I don't know him.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Yes, I believe so.
Dick Laurent?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Andy, who is that guy?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sure.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
No.
Please tell me.
What happened to me?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Did you tell the police this?
Never saw him before in my life.
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Sheila?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Yeah? what did they want?
The police called us.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
You don't look so good.
Sit down.
What's up?
Sit down a minute.
Hey.
Do ya good.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
What night is that?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Yeah.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Okay. Thanks.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Better.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
No.
Have you made any charges against him?
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
His physical condition.
His condition? What do you mean?
Yes.
The wife killer?
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
We saw you that night, Pete.
No... Here he comes.
You talk to him?
Out in back.
Where's Pete?
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
We'll get a tail put on him.
You just gonna let him go?
What's the word on the street?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
Did you ask him who he is?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Where is he now?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Repeat that, Bill.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Yeah, Mack?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Who is it?
No, sir, it's not.
That's not Fred Madison?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Pete, what happened to you?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
I want to see him.
He didn't come home.
What about yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
I wouldn't know how.
He won't give his name.
Who is it?
Who was the man?
We know that.
Nothin'.
What's the matter?
No... I don't. Why?
Do you remember?
Coming up.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
A headache?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
Not even close.
He's not Madison?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Who is this man?
I don't know yet.
What is this, Rogoff?
FUCKIN' "A".
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
No.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
I won't ever tailgate.
I... I didn't say anything...
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
The first night... Not the last two.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Tone deaf.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
What's your axe?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
There's no other bedroom?
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
That's it.
But my head...
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
What is it?
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
What's bothering you, Madison?
No, no. I want to go in.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
My... My head.
Something wrong?
Alice who?
Where's Alice?
That's absurd.
At your house.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
At your house. Don't you remember?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
We've met before, haven't we?
No... of course not.
Was there?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I told you to stay in the car!
He's got some fucked up friends.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
What job?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
But...
Let's go home.
Just a minute.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Where would you feel safe?
Why would anyone do something like this?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
What?
What was that?!!!
I wish I knew.
What the hell is going on?!
Thanks, guys.
We will.
Two detectives are coming out.
So?
All right.
We've got to call the police.
I guess so.
Don't you want to watch it?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
What's that? Another tape?
Who the hell owns that dog?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
You're up early.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
Yeah?
I had a dream about you last night...
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
From the club. You didn't answer.
Called? When?
I called, you know.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
When you didn't come to the club.
What night?
Same one you were reading the other night?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Good book, huh?
Maybe.
It must be from a real estate agent.
No, nothing.
Does it say anything on the tape?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Who's it from?
A videotape.
What's that?
Wake me up when you get home.
That's why I married you.
I like to laugh, Fred.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
What are you going to do?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
The heart, I guess.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Which would you choose?
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
They're gonna cook him.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
Yeah.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Okay.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Mr. Eddy?
You know who it is.
Who is this?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Hello.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
What?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
Okay.
How ya doin', Pete?
You're my man, Pete.
It'll be ready.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
You will.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Suit yourself, champ.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Pornos?
You like pornos?
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
What'd I tell ya.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
At sixty?
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
I can see that.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
All right!
Give that a try.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
What's goin' on?
What?
We just killed a couple of people...
No. No, I don't.
At your house. Don't you remember?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Sheila... Stop...
Go home, Sheila.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Hey... Sheila.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Sheila...
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Come on.
I didn't know you cared.
Yeah.
I was?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Where'd you come from?
I do like you, Sheila.
Why don't you like me?
Come on... get in.
I don't know.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
What do you want?
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Sheila?!
I don't want to talk about it...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
It was weird...
No... I told you.
You really don't remember?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
Sure. Sure I do.
You still care about me?
You were acting like a different person.
Whatiya mean?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Last time I saw you.
What night?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
I don't know.
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Sorry... I...
Why haven't you called me?
Sure.
You want some company?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
What are you guys doin'?
Yeah.
Yeah?...
I missed you.
