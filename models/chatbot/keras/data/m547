That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I can't
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
You going to work all day?
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
We should abort.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
Those lying motherfuckers!
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
What chip?
Do you know about the chip?
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Please... let... the kids... go...
Let me try mine.
No good.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
No one must follow your work.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
Now listen to me very carefully.
My God.
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
Do you have bandages?
I order you not to!
It must end here... or I am the future.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
I have to go away, John.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I'm sorry, John.
No!
Yes.  Throw it in.
Will it melt in there?
Terminated.
Is it dead?
What?
We don't have much time.
Where you going?!
Drive for a minute.
Trust me.
Remember what I said, you can't...
I'll deal with the police.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Drive faster.
This is tactically dangerous.
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
Dyson.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
She intends to change the future somehow.
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
No problemo.
Alriight!!  My man!
No.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Pain causes it?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Why do you cry?
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
You will.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Torque wrench please.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
No.
Not even of dying?
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Excellent.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
Smile?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
No problemo.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Chill out, dickwad.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Affirmative.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
Does it hurt?
Cool.
Everything.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
What?
Swear.
Right.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Why?
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Why?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Prove it... stand on one foot.
That is one of my mission parameters.
You have to do what I say?!
You told me to.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Max.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
I would.
You sure?
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Can I stop by my house?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Where we going?
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Radical.
Liquid metal.
What does that mean?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
My mission is to protect you.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
No way!
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
No shit?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Easy money!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
SHOOT!!!!
John, get out of the way!!
Ready.
Ready to rock?
Go!  I'll finish here.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I know, Mom.  I know.
I love you, John.  I always have.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
Uh huh.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Mom?  You okay?
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
We're better off by ourselves.
Alright, it!  We need it!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
No!  Don't kill him!
Out of the way, John!
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Kyle, don't go!
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I know!
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
They took him from me.
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
I love you.  I always will.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
Open the goddamn door!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
You broke my arm!
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
And what it that?
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
No.  There is another chip.
It's finally over.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
Is it safe for them here?
Can you get us in there, past security?
I must be destroyed.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
The CPU from the first terminator.
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
I have detailed files.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Why attack Russia?
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
And Skynet fights back.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Then what?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Why him?
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
No.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Correct.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
So do you.
You look like handmade shit.
Unknown.
Can it be destroyed?
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Relax now, Sarah --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
Please continue...
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
