I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Die, you pond scum!
Fine.
Fine?
Fine...
You're fired.
Yeah.
Oh... I'm fired?
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
... what?
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
I'm... not... nobody...
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
Share...
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
What do you think you're doing?!
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Choices???
Great.
.. Nothing.
Well it's a last minute change.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
) Listen, you little...
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Alan
That shelter was in this bill.
No...
The Washington Post.
What the hell is this ?
What the hell is this?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Mr. President...
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
... Alright.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
Dave...
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I'm not certain about...
Great.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
I promise.  I won't.
Right and don't embellish.
A month.
For a month.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Don't worry about it.
What's with her?
Don't worry.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Oh... Okay.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Holy cow.
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
You're kidding?
They barely talk anymore.
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
First Lady...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
How much do you usually get paid?
The usual...
No more than the usual.
Is this dangerous or anything?
What?
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Right.
Don't say a .
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Jesus...
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Uh-oh...
Sort of... Yeah.
Are you threatening me?
Just what you think I mean.
What do you mean by that?
Then we'll all go to jail together.
I'll lock him away for good.
Don't do this.
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Bob...
It's not his job -- It's my job!
He was only doing his job.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
What I told him to?
He's only doing what you told him to.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Bob...
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
You can't kill a President.
I'm going to kill him.
What are you gonna do?
I don't think so.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
Oh.  Fine.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
What's with the cameras?
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
No!...  WE didn't anything...
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Three years.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
You're kidding.
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
When does it break?
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Oh.  Excuse me.
It's a homeless shelter.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Uh, let me get back to you...
Are you out of your mind?
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
What about the wife?
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Fine.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
And...
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
What about her.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Is that everybody?
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
What about containment, Alan?
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
I was a senator, you know.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Yes.
We think so.
Exactly. A condition.
A condition...
Soon.
Up and around?  Soon?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Mild stroke?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Like how?
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
TilT we figure something out.
Till what?
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Bob...
I don't give a shit.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Just don't call him, Alan!
... What?
Don't call the Vice President!
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Nightmare...
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Where's the girl?
I know.
I can't believe he'd do this.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Well -- take care.
That'd be great.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
So what do we do?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
You could buy it on payments.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Choices?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
I'm not sure.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I'm not sure.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I am the government.
The government
And who's gonna find out?
This is undeclared income.
I don't think so
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
They could put you in jail.
It's fine.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Dave -- I'm working.
So you want to go swimming?
He's not.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
She knows.
`Dave'?
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
We've got to fix this.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Alan...
Wrong...
This is wrong, Alan!
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
What do you mean you made it all up?
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
We vetoed that?
President vetoes works bill?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
What?
Gimme a quarter.
Fine.
Fine.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
Dave!
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
Dave...
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Thanks, I wrote it.
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
What?
At a press conference.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Presence.
Oh.
I don't think so.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
What?
A teleprompter.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
I see what you mean.
In the car.
In the car?
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
I'm not sure... I might have.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Really?   Crazy?
I'm afraid so.
No.
Oh, yeah... probably...
Will he be alright?
Oh my gosh...
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
What happened?
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Oh my God...
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
Extend things?
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Why?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Perceptual?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Does it make the cars any better?
And it's proving quite effective...
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Yes, Mr. President?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
How'd you get started?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
Really?
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
You know.  Your first campaign.
What?
You ever think back to how you started.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
... Sometimes they do.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Yeah.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Oh... Hi.
I just fired Bob Alexander.
What do you mean?
They re not my attack dogs.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
The Fidelity nonsense...
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Something like what...
Certainly.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Ah.
Fertility beads.
What are they?
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Oh... Thanks.
This is from the people of Burundi...
Thanks, Duane.
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
Well...
Well...
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
The Vice-President...
Who?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
No... They don't kid.
You're kidding.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
What's that?
`Bleed for your king.'
You mean with you and everything?
I had a feeling.
I was waiting for that jack.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
Certainly.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
What about it?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
No.
You ever use it?
Of course.
You got a gun?
Yeah.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
Oh.
I can't say.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
Really?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
What?
Your government needs your help.
No.
You're not?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Yeah... It could be fun.
It could be fun.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
So this is it?
... Me, too.
I missed...
I know.
I never thought I'd...
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
It's nice.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Hi.
Hi.
What?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
I sure fall for some weird guys.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
You really believe that?
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
They're crucifying you out there.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
What's wrong?
That's okay.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
I know. I'm sorry...
I can't.
What?
Yeah... Bedtime.
Well I guess...
It was inspirational.
It was okay?
But you could go to jail for it.
I know.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
You find people jobs?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
I run a temp agency.
Yes.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
So what do you do the rest of the time?
I guess.
You have a lot of secrets.
That's a secret.
Just wait.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
What?
Are you hungry?
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
It's just so strange...
What?
Oh... Okay.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
Thanks.
I don't mind.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
Truman used it all the time.
You sure this goes somewhere?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
How were you gonna get home?
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
You1re leaving, too?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Where's home?
Home.
Where are you going?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
You're leaving?
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
They asked me to help.
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
I don't know.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
You weren't in the state legislature.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Anybody would have done it.
That was quite a thing you did today.
No.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh... Yeah.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
... . Ellen.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
You made their funding disappear!
What's wrong with a magic trick?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
I don't understand.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
... How could I what?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
I care about the homeless.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
What?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I'm outta here.
You bet.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
Uh...
What are you staring at?
Fabulous.
All set.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
What about the intro?
We're all set,  sir.
We're doing our best, sir.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're working on it.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
The Monroe?
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
