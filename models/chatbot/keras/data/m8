You're not taking my baby!
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
It's okay, Dan
Excuse us, dear.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
But how...?
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
What do you mean?
He's inside you, where he hides.
Where is he?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Mommy...?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Who says I don't like you?
Who said I...wait, what?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
She doesn't want me around
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
No...
Is that who you're waiting for?
Been having bad dreams.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
How did you know that?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
My name is...
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Huh?
Hey...wake up.
Me too.
There you go.  Love you.
You're right.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Yeah...I guess.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
About him?
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
I know.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
The tickets.
Sorry, babe.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Hi, beautiful.
Now.
But Dad --
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
I've got to go.
Alice!
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
You disappointed in me?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Alice...
Very funny.
Sobering...
How was the meeting?
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
I'm so sorry, honey...
It's just across the park.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
To take a picture.
Where are we going?
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Dad!
No.  A deal's a deal.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
He sure loves to stay awake.
So did Dan.
You do good work, Alice.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
But how are we gonna --
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
What?
If they actually bothered to bury her.
You think that's the place she's buried?
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
That's the only reason you're alive...
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Krueger is reality.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
What's that got to do with it?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Did everyone call everyone?
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Had kind of a long night.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
I don't understand.
No shit.
Poor woman...
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
But I've seen her grave.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Meaning?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
That's their problem.
They think I'm nuts.
Then we'll find another way.
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Where are you going?
I don't know!
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
What, you named it already?
My baby!
Who's Jacob?
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Nobody thinks that.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Mark!
Then get out!
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
I thought about that.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Mark, are you okay?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
I've got to write some of this down.
Well we gotta do something!
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Who?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
My undying love.  Have some.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
All of us.  Right?
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
I want to talk about the baby.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Yeah...
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Makes you look like a nun--
These things are wild...  What do you think?
He invited me to his house last night.
You, too?
Stick around, please?
It's okay.
I can't listen to this.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
Mark...
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Faint.
Vomit?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
