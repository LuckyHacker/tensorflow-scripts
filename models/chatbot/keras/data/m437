With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
Doing...?
No.  I was in Namibia...
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
Lemon or lime?
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
They'll kill Gina.
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
With Sonny.  110%.
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Oh, yeah...
He any good?
Sal Maguda.
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
"And" what?
And...?
I was the kids' godfather.
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
Grieve elsewhere.
We know these people...!
Turn around.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
What's your twenty?
Yeah.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
You can't.
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
It's a rip and a hit.
What do you think?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Where's the new drop point...?
Jos√© Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Yeah?
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Good.
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Recruit us to do what?
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
I got to talk to my ADO...
Yes you do...
I don't know.
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Sure.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
You need to consider a few issues.
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
Tell them what you want.
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
We're not certain!
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
We're not certain...
Deal.
Make it 35.
Make it 40%.
25% discount on the load.
My end?
Two main players plus three.
How many?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
I got the item.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
So...?
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
I know.  And now?
No part of it wasn't real.
No.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
If they attack you...
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
Yero, by himself?
I'll be on board by noon.
...in the morning.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Is this the protective male talk?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
Where would I go?
Of course.
Would you find me...?
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
When?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Really?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Do I need it?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Why?
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
What's the best fortune you ever got?
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
I forgot the napkins.
Hola, viejo.
Hola, chica.
Maybe I'm only one.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Twenty-eight-point-five.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Zero risk.
Good samba dancing...?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Did Christmas come early this year...?
What do you mean?
Is it December?
Cost less.  That's the point.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Like...?
Exactly.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
That's right.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
You know how improbable this is...?
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
Died in childbirth, having me...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
I insist.
No.
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
I dance...
Later!  Do you dance?
Mojitas...?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
How's he not your husband?
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
Your father?
She's dead...
Where's she now?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Were you born in Havana?
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Havana.
The Keys?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Where's that?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Show me...?
It goes very fast.
How fast does that go?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
What do you like to drink?
And what is that?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
What's "nothing"?
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Okay.
We want it back.
Right now.
When?
You do.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
'Cause she will tell you.
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
What friend?
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
You got something to say, Jos√©, let's hear it.
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Yeah?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Packaging?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
What'd Neptune tell you?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
And what do I do with him?
Yeah.
I'll be there.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
Red light, green light, Jos√©?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
You afraid of violence?
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
What...?
Sit.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Jos√©...
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
What's the point?  It's going down.
What's your take?
And Jos√©, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
I would never doubt you.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
I am asking.  You to me.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
As in...?
What is going on...?!
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
Chill out Sonny.
Hey, fuck him.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
We're makin' moves on each other.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
No.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
Havana, Cuba...?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Verdado where?
Verdado.
Where?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Where'd you go?
On my way back...
Where the hell are you, man?
Nothing.
How much we looking for?
Good.  So let's go...
No.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Like...?
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
To the limit.
Who knows...
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Five minutes...
What do we got?
Port-Au-Prince.
Where we meeting 'em...?
Nothing.
Anything?
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Then it don't work.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What kind of weight?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
"No, viejo.  That was Jos√© Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
So?
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Something's wrong.
Stevens?
Alonzo...
What is it?
Hello, Miss Ukraine...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
And there's Dmitri...
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
What's our deal?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
Then you should.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Switek?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Go ahead.
You're giving away your money, fool...
Twenty on my man...
Eleven to seven he blows it.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Control your men.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Out of...?
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
What are you talking about?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Never heard of him.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
From whom...?
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
To recruit you.
So what do you want?
We don't know.
How?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
That's right.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Okay.  What's up?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Detective Crockett.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Hello?
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
How will it stand up?
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
Have faith.
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
How'd they get onto you?
Goodbye.
Alonzo...!
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Where are you?
After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
I don't understand...
They had me from the gate.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
On the phone.
Where's Riccardo?
Yeah.
Sonny...?
Yeah...?
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
Who are you talking to?
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
C'mon, man!
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
Oh, good...
White supremacist types.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Okay.
"Salutations from the south..."
What's it say?
You mean with the flowers...?
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
What flowers?
...and thanks for the flowers.
Okay...see you soon.
Bored.
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Yes.  What's up?
You sure?
Yeah.
You okay?
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
He did volunteer one time...
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
So?
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
What would you do...?
I think Jos√© suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Why?
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
And...?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Jos√© doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Not French registry?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
Meaning...?
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos√© knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
You set this up!
That sonofabitch!
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
Conveyance?
"Future" of...?
And as an investment in the future...
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Define small.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
