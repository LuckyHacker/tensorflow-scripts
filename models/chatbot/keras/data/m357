What?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Mr. Doyle.
What?
Doyle.
What's my name?
This side.
Where do you want it?
Who knows?
Who brings it?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
What?
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Got a wife named Angie.
Doesn't register.
B.O.C.A.
Boca?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Everything is everything.
How's everything?
Cause if I do.
No - no.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
No. 
You don't use shit?
I'm clean.
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
Don't forget anchovies. 
Yeah?
Sal --
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Well try, okay?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Where are you?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Man, I'm clean.
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
No... yeah...
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't...
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
What's your name, asshole?
Goodbye.
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
I wasn't looking.
Did they follow you?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did you pick up the car?
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
It's yours too!
It's your problem.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Yes --
Twelve o'clock... yes...
... Salvatore?...
Who's this --
Allo... Salvatore...
That's a relief.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Are you sure it is dead?
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Non!
Le sommes nous?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
Comment va-t-elle?
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Pour moi?
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Encore du sho ping!
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Si tu veux.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
There'll be someone else.
Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
He is not wrong.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
But will they?
We must follow it.
What happens to the schedule?
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
Il est en retard.
Il fallait le faire.
Sale boulot.
Mmm.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Who financed it?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
It's beautiful.
Fake it.
I got no music!
You're for real?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
What?
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
S'right.
You're in show business.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
What's your story?
Yeah, I know.
That's in France.

Marseilles.
Where's he from?
I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Yeh?  Who else?
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
What's he do?
Des Moines.
Where from?
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Names.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
There's nobody like that on six.
We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
He got off on six.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
Morning.  Sometime.
When ya go back on?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Strike out, eh?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Where the hell is it?
Yeah!
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Why not?
You want some eggs.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Willie Mays.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Who's on him?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Third time around.
Same car.
Four.
Timezit?
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
We put him to bed for the night.
What about Sal?
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Pour it in your ear.
You want the red or the white?
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
You got the warrant?
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
What happened to you?
Let yourself in.
Why not?
I can't.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Yeah.
Popeye.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
Suspicion of what?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
Come on -- just for fun --
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
The greaser with the blonde.
Give who a tail?
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
No, you?
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
Policy man in Queens.
Who is that guy?
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Whip it out.
Drink this.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Not a chance.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
He coulda been white.
Never trust a nigger.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Pass.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Whatta you got?
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Hiya, Jesus.
Hey, Bo.
For dead bodies.
For garbage?
It was a crematorium.
What was it?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What is that old building?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
Why is it called Hellgate?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Darling, may I have this one?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Just for mistakes of parking?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
I been damn careful up to now.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
