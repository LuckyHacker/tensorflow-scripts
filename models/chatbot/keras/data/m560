Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
Watch your language....
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
No one follows that midrash.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
You think?! Based on what?
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
The Nazis did everything the f√ºhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
They sound like you.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
They don't have extermination camps.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
What's a fascist?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They only kill them when they love them?
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
That's a movie, you moron.
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
What??
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
He's an asshole.
Fucking Danny, man...
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Just don't.
Why the fuck not?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
How come you know all this shit?
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
Fire...
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
I don't, but...
What do you care?
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
Oh, please...
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Yes.
Do we have to listen to this shit?
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
You coming?
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
What, do you like it here?
Then I won't bring you....
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
Who the fuck are you?
What do you think you're doing?
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
You will.
I don't care about money.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
People still need values, beliefs....
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
I have a job.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
You don't own this place.
You gotta get out of here.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
And be crushed.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
No. What are you looking for?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Lina, come here!
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
You want a punch in the mouth?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Do they?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
I told you, I'm good at this.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
No, I think you shouldn't.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
You shouldn't.
Why should I submit?
Don't curse in front of it.
Fuck that.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
And belief follows?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
What's it about?
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
No difference.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
V'asitem...
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Even though his dick is so big?
The sex is better.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Where are they?
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
It looks a little like a swastika.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
You can't curse in front of it either.
What assholes.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
That's stupid.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Why not?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
I'm good at languages.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Why?
I want to learn to read it.
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
What's it mean?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Oh, yeah... 
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
What do you care?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
No.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
How come there's no punctuation?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Where'd you get this?
No.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
He's at a home out here.
Your father??
You can't.
When can I see you?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
Why won't you talk to me?
Who's Linda?
Then how come you're talking to me?
Bigger and better.
Oh, really?
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
That's stupid. Why would they?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Killing himself.
What's he care about?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Is he a Nazi?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Are they still together?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
You want it to be an event.
Why no silencer?
I just read it....
Where'd you read all that stuff?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
You're not in school? What do you do?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
Which is what?
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
Disease? What disease?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Too difficult?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
That's a much easier game.
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
I didn't realize you cared.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
I'm stealing it.
Why are you taking that?
Nothing. Let's go....
What'd you say?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Who's Eichmann?
I'll go look....
I thought there were people here....
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
An investment banking house.
Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
What's that?  Okay. Surprise us...
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
It's the truth....
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
They're liars and cowards.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
How would you kill him?
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
You wouldn't announce it?
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
Obviously.
More cultural than political.
Get the fuck away from me.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
Who killed Manzetti?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
I don't think you know what you are.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Explain it so I can.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
How do you reconcile the two?
What were you, following me?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
No.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Give me a reason not to.
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Listen to me....
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
So you're saying it's not true.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Who? How would I know him?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
Are all Jews the same?
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Of course they're Jews.
Those aren't Jews.
He has Israel.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Female...
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Why?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
And Jewish men like to get it.
I don't know. Is that right?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Notice? Like what...?
And? WHat did you notice?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
What??!?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
A poison...?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Danny, what about the Jews?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
I agree.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
What about Curtis Zampf?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
Is it okay if I record this?
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Fucking kike.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Think about your father. Your sister.
I can't say that.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
But I wasn't.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
You're lying.
It was a nine millimeter.
A forty-five.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
How did you...?
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
This is me.
I can't help what I think.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I thought you hated Torah.
To hear them read Torah.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
The arguments, anyway.
I always won.
Yes!
No!
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Don't tell me what I --
You do it on the inside....
I don't do that.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
How did you get the fucking number?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
What is happening?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Hello...?
We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
Fine.
How have things been going?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
So what Jew would you kill first?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
From the Rhineland originally.
What part of Germany are you people from?
It's German.
Balint?
Daniel Balint.
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Steve's going to explain it.
Steve...
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
That's meat.
What about chicken?
You can heat them up and eat with him.
I've got to get back to the --
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
What kids?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Tell it to Hitler.
They're not my people....
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
What are you doing here?
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
A Jewish prayer.
Who knows what that is?
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Isn't it true?
Who told you that?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
<i>New York Times</i>...?
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Hello...?
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
When do you want it to go off?
Just do it.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
I have an idea....
Where?
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
So what do we do with the device?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Why? Why would she?
Mrs. Moebius.
Who even knew?
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Not too fast.
Christ...
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Oh, what is this shit?
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
Didn't you get anything?
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
That's all we've got left.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
It will.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
This will be a different kind of device.
Here...
Open it up.
What...?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
What is it?
The mother.
Which one were you aiming at?
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Get out of here....
You could do it.
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Number ten.
Which was his room?
Get out of my way.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
Shut up...
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Wow, that's uh...great...
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
You remember Miriam....
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Are you an artist?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
JTS...?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
What's that?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
You missed on purpose.
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
How?
I can tell....
How did you know they were Jews?
Four. But no one this important.
Who'd you kill?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
Why me?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Where do you think you're going?
What do you think you should have done?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
You can't say that....
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
What are you trying to say?
And what did you do?
Just a little... What's the difference?
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Valentine...
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
He was funny.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
Funny?
Adam Sandler.
Obviously.
Howard Stern.
No.
Leary?
Dennis Leary.
Who's this?
Exactly.
"Do chickens give milk?"
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Do I give a shit?
It's Friday....
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Do you think I...
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Are you out of your mind?!
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
What?
We tested the new bomb.
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
They're not that Jewish.
So what?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
We think you'd be good at it.
Fund-raising??
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Oh, fuck you...
And let us say...
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Eat shit....
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
What do you mean?
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
