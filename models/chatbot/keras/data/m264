Beavis.
Yer late.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Does that say Xanax?
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Heh heh, thanks.
They perk me right up.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Really? I poop too much.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Thrr...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
...Two...
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
Who knows?
Where are his pants?
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Chief, look!
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Not now Bork.
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Agent Hurley...
Not on him, Chief.
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
D.C., Chief.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Where did these guys come from?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
That's better. Yes?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Deep and hard.
Cavity search...?
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Cut the power!
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
I see it. I don't get it.
You see what I see, Bork?
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Ah, the witness?
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Talk ta me, Bork.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
She sure does.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Do her? Huh huh.
Uh, Butt-Head.
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Cool, huh huh huh.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
You scored with two chicks?!
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Really? That's where we're from.
Yup. Huh huh.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Uh, ten uh...
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Who sent ya?
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
You got two seconds!
