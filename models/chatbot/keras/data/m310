Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
I didn't have the heart.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I'll go and make up his room!
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
You're back!
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
Then leave her to me.
Yes.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I don't care about your sword.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Who are you?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
And if I use them to kill you?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Why do you want to teach me?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Go ahead.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
On guard!
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Do you think you are a real master?
What's it to you?
Where's your master?
I do as I please.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Let's go!
Tell me, who is your master?
I'm just playing around.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
What's it to you?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
I owe you nothing.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Shut up!
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
You're already a thief.
I'll never live as a thief!
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
You're home late... or should I say early?
He is my defeated foe!
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
So what if I don't?
You don't seem to understand.
Don't bother.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Long.
Hello.  What is your name?
I have a guest.
This spells trouble.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
I'm tired now.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Do you know her?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Put them down.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Please sit.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Come and get it if you can.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Where is he now?
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
You know about Lo?
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
They forced me to marry!
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
You, sister...
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
I'll give them to you.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Here you must be in proper attire.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
You say she killed a policeman?
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
No, really?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Please.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
You're doing calligraphy?
I'm bored.
How so?
I've missed you.
You're probably right.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
What do you think?
You're not married, are you?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Really?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
You're a sword fighter too?
You're too young to understand.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Then you have no use for the sword.
Never!
Kneel!
Give it back!
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
What do you want?
Only the sword will settle this.
Let's end this here.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Make a wish, Lo.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Don't ever come back.
Jen...
Go.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
I will.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Don't send me back!
It is trouble for me.
Let them look.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Give it back.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Give me back my comb.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
You coward!
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
My comb!
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
Give it back!
Let's stop a moment.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
You shouldn't have come.
Jen!
Lo?
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Save your strength.
Shu Lien...
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
We followed Jade Fox.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
What happened?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
I'll look around and catch up later.
What about you?
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Don't you want to see her again.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
But Wudan does not accept women.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
She needs direction... and training.
I knew she would intrigue you.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
Well, we had talked...
Then, why did you come?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
No, not yet...
Have you questioned him yet?
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
No.
Did you see who posted it?
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
What have you discovered?
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
Perhaps.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
So what will you do now?
It's time for me to leave it behind.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
What was it?
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
You were enlightened?
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
I left the training early.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Yes.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Fine.
Good.  And how are you?
It has.  How's business?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
A murderer?
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
But don't be too lenient.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
What does it say?
They're gone.
Father!
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
We must avenge mother!
It's Jade Fox!
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
What do you have in mind?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
This is a delicate matter.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
I don't know...
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
