Nope.  Never. 
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Brad?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
What? What did you tell me?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
There's no vodka in it.
Not enough vodka in it.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Tuesday.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Mr. Roebush?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
What are you talkin' about?
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
What?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Yeah? What do you want?
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
The kid needs a man to show him --
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
I seem to be.
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!
Brad Wilson.
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Anyday...
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Well, aren't you excited?
Uh-huh.
He really was!
Can I help?
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Call me.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
Old ties are hard to cut.
I can never get a way from it.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Me neither...
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
No, thanks.
Peanut butter and jelly.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
There's a lot of choices here.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
Me??
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
I mean him.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
I just can't stand this.
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
You thought that?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Oh...I came close once.
You...um...you never got married?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
Who?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
But Lana, you could --
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
I didn't --
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
Too much mayonnaise?
You know what's the problem?
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
It sure is.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
You're welcome...??
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
You look wonderful.
Clark.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Kent!
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Oh. You're going away.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Sure.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
We get together sometimes.
Do you really know Superman?
What!
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Mom and I do this all the time.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Oh?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
You're the best, Lois.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
Say!
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
What are you doing?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
At one o'clock in the morning?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
What's that?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Mmmmm . . .
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?

What about this week's check?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
I know, I'm the fault.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
A television set?
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Thirty-five.
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Nope, but --
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Kitchen. . . Technician
What kind?
Yeah.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Gus Gorman.
Name?
Say who?
The boss wants to see you.
Say what?
Gus?
Yeah. A raise . .
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
One.  And a half.
How many sugars?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
So where is all them half-centses?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Who gets it, the company?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
First paycheck?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
You want to mess with Superman?
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Can you do that?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Stone mutha.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Yeah? How's it look?
Tell me more...
Anything.
What will it get me?
Everything.
What will it do?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
You designed it?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
We've already got some.
A computer.
For what?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
What do you want?
Fair's fair.
Is this whitemail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this blackmail?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Now...when do I get a taste?
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
They ain't got captains?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Huh?
KRYPTONITE!
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
God, that's what I keep you for.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
What are you talking about, fella?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Turn on the T.V.
Just the man I wanted to see!
Hey, boss.
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
What?
First question got to be "Where."
When?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
How do you do that?
That what they call you?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Me? How?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Wipe 'em out?
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
Columbia.
Columbia.
Which country?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Decaffeinated too?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Man, what is this?
I don't think you understand.
Black or regular?
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
I'm tryin' to.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Or socks.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Uh...
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Thanks.  Let's go
Just a second.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
No...I just have a little stop to make.
We back in Metropolis?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
We gonna crash?
No, we're just going down.
Watch out for them air pockets!
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
How you doing down there?
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
I know, by computers.
And do what?
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
What she call you?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Sister! I'm his sister!
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
It was hot!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Why do I have to do this?
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
What about you?
What about me?
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
I didn't have my camera with me.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
Who's the other woman?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
Who is she?
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
But the bridge...
There's no rush.
You just did, with that great dinner.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
We've already met.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Anytime.
Thank ...you.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Ricky?  Where...what...
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Whoopee.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
What terrific story?
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
The picture looks blurry.
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
But the other night...
I don't know you, lady.
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Tell me.
Lots of things...
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I thought you'd never get here.
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
I can't! It's out of control!
He can have mine. Anytime.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Oh, Superman!
In other words, push this red button.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Superman. The boy you left behind.
Gus?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Where's the light switch?
Turn on the light.
I can't see anything.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
How would you know?
Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
Diet soda?
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Where's the handle?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Why do I have to do this?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Mr. White, the next number, please?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Okay? Goodbye.
53!
53.
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
Hello.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
Missing????
85,000 dollars.
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Yes! This time we got it right!
Don't bet on it!
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
He's the only one who can operate this --
Who needs Gus?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
We can get to work on that oil!
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
A normal person.
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
So?
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
Where did it come from?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
What's wrong?
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Don't cry, Bubba.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
We already have a super-tanker.
Small potatoes.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
Today coffee----
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
She's not his mama either.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Storms! Floods!
It could make weather!
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
I don't kiss.
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
