Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
But why would they do that...?
With his hands!
Two heartbeats.
Two what...?
There are two.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
But you've not told Michael.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
Then what is he...?
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Rowan...
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
What are you talk---
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Every day  twice.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
Nothing was ever more false.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
What have the witches always asked of you...?
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
Michael, Rowan should -
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Rowan.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
A what...?
Come.  There is a lot to read
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
Then you wear it.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
I don't want it.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
He made that quite clear, yes.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
I want to see my mother.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
You - are - a - murderer.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
ENOUGH!!!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Stop it!
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
It wes a dream...!
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
'He'...?
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
You're a monster.
She didn't feel them
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
Better than most, I suppose.
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
The lamplight.  That's all.
What is it...?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Eighty million doll --- ?
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
I don't want the -
There are things I have to know!
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
Who the hel1 -
I had you sent away.
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
I under5tand.  All the same
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
My...mother...?
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
Who is this...?
When did she die...?
I beg your par---
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Who is this...?
Hello...?  Who is this...?
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Lasher - bring us through!
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Michael...  Do what you can.
Help us.  Do what you can.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
He just went out like & light-
uh - then he - be just -
FAST.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Anybody got a BP yet...?
Parents say he - uh - fell -
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
Oh god...
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
No!
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
I don't know what you are!!!
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
I do not understand...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
What is wrong...?
Leave me alone!
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Only you...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Then help me--- for his sake...
I love Michael...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
But have I...?  Ever...?!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
I know that you're evil.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE him!
But I could understand. I want to understand!
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
It's too soon to know.
A girl...?
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
If that were true, I would not be here.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
There is no one here but the dead.
I bring her flowers too.
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?

It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
If you knew how I yearn for that...
To love, you must be able to feel.
It is from love.
Made it...?
You bastard...
Explain this to me --- violated...?
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
Always loved you..
STOP!
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
Like this...?
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
There are things you will not tell him.
Lie...?
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
I know.    you are my son -
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Yessss...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Harder...
Rowan...
Harder...
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
No.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
You bastard!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Stop it!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I can't.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
Gotcha.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
Hi.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Something's wrong with you.
Go ahead.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
What were you talking about...?
When aid you get home last night...?
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
A bit much.    Lucas.
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
I don't know.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
Is he - is he gonna die...?
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
You alright...?
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
Your beneficence.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
- we made a fire.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Talking to me dear...?
You did that, didn't you...?
That's not funny.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
That's cause we're below sea level.
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
I love you too.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
No.    This is unreal...
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
Michael!
Did you see the old man on the ---
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Mm-hmm...
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Mm-hmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Mm-hmmm...
You look a little green.
Dropped it.
Hey - you're bleeding.
A little wine...?
Wanna snack...?
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Their what...?
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
That's GREAT!
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
Hello..
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
You sure...?
Let's see.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
What about your work back home...?
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Do you love me, Michael...?
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
- a witch.
She - she said I - I was a ---
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
You know...?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
What about you coming down here...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
What's wrong..?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Rowan...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Hello...?
Mad. for each other.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.

Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
God knows, I'm intriguing.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Seems more like a year than a month.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Stop it.
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
I'm serious.  You don't -
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
All I meant was -
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Captain's orders.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
He fools around with his patients too.
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
Too much... too fast...?
Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Really...?  Your family there...?
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
You still feel that crazy...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
And whose houses do you design...?
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
What else did you see- Michael...?
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
you're very --- different.
Yessssss...
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
HARDER!
Rowan...
Harder...
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
The one time I want it to work...
Just one.  The bar's closed.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
What do you see...?
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
My jury's still out on that,
I'm glad you're around to say it.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
They like you ------- kids.
Just don't fall off any ladders.
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
You okay...?
If you like that type.
Wow...
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
You can't just -
On which planet...?
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
