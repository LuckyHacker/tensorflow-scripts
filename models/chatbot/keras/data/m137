They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Five CC's.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Monkeybone?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
What?
Switch hands.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Yeah...before your time.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Who did this?
I don't know. I guess it was...
Special occasion?
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I didn't say anything.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Sad commentary, huh?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Stu Miley.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Olive or eyeball?
Uhh - martini?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Thank me next time you see me.
Death! Thank you!
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Back? You're sending me back?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
DEATH!!
Bend over?
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Well - you'd need a body.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
<u>Why</u>??
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
At the moment, yes.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
You're really gonna pop the question?
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
How much?
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Less.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
What's the matter?
A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
...In some weird way I respect that.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Why?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Holy shit.
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Monkeybone...!?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Tell me what?
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Uh huh. And?
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
He called me "Doc."
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
I need a new PR guy.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Got a doctor on duty.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Ohhh, nothing.
What are you watching?
<i></i> In what way?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Sure. Why?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Bitchin' good cake.
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
What's the matter?
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
How was it? I don't recall.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Stu?
I'd better go report this...
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Are you okay??
I don't think so.
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I might wake up.
What's the "bad" part?
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Who?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Can't you give it to me later?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Give me a date, Doctor.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
The ring...
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
When'd you get in?
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Don't ask where I got it.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Hypnos?
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Isn't that Lulu?
What?
Stu...LOOK!
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...Stu...
I don't <u>know</u>.
Where'd he go??
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
All right. You can come.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
<u>What</u> union?
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
