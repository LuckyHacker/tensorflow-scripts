Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
He was trying to steal my car!
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
It's the Chancellor.
He's right, you look horrible.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
So I hear.
You snore.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
The candelabras were my Gran's.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
I peeked.
You peeked, didn't you?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
Me? What can I do?
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
No. But I don't think that matters.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Came to my senses.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
In a sense.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
That was MacCaulay.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Naturally you have copies.
Call it a hunch.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
No wonder he screwed us over.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
...we find the jacket.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Such as.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
The hood jumper?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
So whose car is it?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Don't touch it.
Want some help with that?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Find the jacket.
So -- what do we do now?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Evidently.  Coming!
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Who do you think it is?
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
So what's the problem?
Shut up, James.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Is he awake?
Ye-es?
Crabtree.
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
So sensitive.
So modest.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
What's to tell?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Competence.
Which is?
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
How bad is it for you?
Only in your bones?
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
Maybe... I don't know.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
His parents.
Kidnapped? By who?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
James? My James? What's happened?
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
You stay there.
Tripp, where the hell...
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Shit.
Tripp?!
Where would we go?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Shit.
Just go around him.
What's this guy's problem?
Hit your brakes.
Yes.
Tripp.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
He heard everything we were saying.
That was good.
Because... because...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
He lives with his mother.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Not Curtis.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Shut up and drink.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
He is. Take my word for it.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
No. Not yet he isn't.
So. Is he any good?
He finished it Winter Break.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He has a book.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Is that just beer?
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
She left me. Crabs.
Trip??
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
He said something about being between things.
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
I just mean...
I thought you were tinkering.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Isn't she?
Mm.
She's still a transvestite.
You're stoned.
She's a transvestite.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Your wife.
Emily?
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
How are you, Crabtree?
Tripp!
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
I'll be... somewhere else.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
No...
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
How are you -- is it Joe?
Bullshit.
You must be mistaken.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
It's mine.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Excuse me?
You driving this car?
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
No. There's no one here.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Better luck next time.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
Her dog, yes.
She told you about...
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
I know.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
Is that in my chart?
And your wife left you.
I've been trying to finish a book...
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been having them?
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
You did.
I passed out.
Stop calling me Vernon.
Sure.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Boy or girl?
Shoot.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
'Fraid so.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Who the hell is that?
No, really...
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Relax, Vernon...
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Who's got a gun?
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Vernon.
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
Yea?
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Goodbye, Grady.
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
...reconcile with Emily.
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
With Emily?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
You're in Kinship?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Hello?
Even if I end up going to jail....
Yes, James.
Professor Tripp...?
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I'm a little worried, James.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Get out of here.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Near Carvel?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I'm not going, with them.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm not going with them.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
Where you going?
Okay.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
When nobody's looking.
When?
I eat.
It's because you don't eat.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
What would you call them then?
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
No thanks.
Want a bite?
In a minute. Get us a table.
You coming?
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
I'm sorry.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
But, last night...
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I didn't mean it that way.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
I never said that.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
The hell I am.
You're lying.
Not you. Your talent.
Jealous? Of me?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Because of my coat?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
It's warm.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
So, why did you take me up there?
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
What?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
I just wanted a little sip.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
It feels really... good... here.
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
You can see the outline of a butt.
How can you tell?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
That's right. That one.
The one that left you?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
Kinship. And what's here?
Kinship.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Amazing.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
What kind of dancer?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I never heard of it.
Outside Scranton.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Carvel.
Where's that?
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Colon cancer.
Glaucoma?
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Maybe...
Humboldt County?
Your aunt?
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
No.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Yeah, well, actually...
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Hm.
Isn't this...?
I don't know...  Me.
Who?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
But James. I mean... How long?
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
The bus station.
So where have you been staying?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
Well done, James.
How's that?
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
How did I get here last night?
Hm.
Professor Tripp?
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
Blocked.
Washed up?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
But... ?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
That's a big book you're writing.
Afraid so.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Yes.
What'd you tell him?
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
What'd he say?
The guy on the phone.
Who?
He didn't give his name.
Sure.
Want me to get that?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Oh.
I put you on the floor.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
What's he saying?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Is he all right?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Can I ask you something about her?
Miss Sloviak's.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
I've got tenure.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
You?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
What are we going to do with...
Yea, James.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
I had to. Didn't I?
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Right.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Like the lady herself.
They're glass. The buttons.
Really.
Really?
Go ahead.
So I'm told.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
That's really it.
Is that really it?
This is worth it.
I'll miss my bus.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
Heaven?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
You're right.
It's colder in there.
So what are you doing out here?
A little.
You cold, James?
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
Really? That's remarkable.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Well...
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
It's not bad.
Sounds like a good one.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
No! What gave you that idea?
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
...You carry firearms.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
It's very convincing.
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
No, it's not that, it's...
That good, huh?
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
It beats 'What's your major?'
He cribbed that from Borges.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
But where? I need the street.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
Who does?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Jesus.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Grady!
Hey.
Oh. Well. I...
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
That strikes me as odd.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
Do?
So what are you going to do?
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I thank you.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
James'll know about George Sanders.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Just checking.
Me? Sure. Why?
I think so... What about you?
Thanks for that. He all right?
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Yes, Hannah?
I know, but sometimes...
You don't deserve me, you know.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Did you just make that up?
It didn't come up.
Does he still love you?
I told Walter.
Did you tell Walter?
Some times...
I guess you have to go on faith.
Oh?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Ouch. How many?
And you're old.
I know.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I lost it all.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I'm through improvising.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I said it didn't sound like you.
And what did you say?
He told me.
He told you.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might have.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
Would Walter really press charges?
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Grady.
Someone stole my car.
Over there. In the backseat of the...
And the jacket?
Inside.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Oh?
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Sara.
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
What's he doing out there?
James Leer.
Who's that sitting in your car?
That... and you.
About the baby.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Really, Sara, I...
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
All right.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I'm kidding. Hello?
Really? That was fast.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Did you confess?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
You heard? How?
I heard.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I love you, Grady.
You got me.
Pow.
Caps.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Who's gun is that?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Not have it.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Well...
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Is the thing -- is it over?
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Neither do I.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Yes.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Hm.
Is that Cristaile?
Simple.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
She's left before...
Emily left me this morning.
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
I'm sure.
I'm pregnant.
All right. This morning --
You go first.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
New?
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I need to talk to you.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
Easy there.
I got the message you called too.
I got the message you called.
Chancellor.
Professor Tripp.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
What's that?
He's writing his name in water.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Listen, Antonia --
Sure it is.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
James is... I don't know...
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
I'm your man.
I need a ride.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
Who's he barking at now?
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
That's a nice greenhouse.
Lucky guess.
Why yes. How did you know?
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
The more the merrier.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
No.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Excuse me?
I'm in love with your wife.
What is it, Grady?
I... I...
Oh?
This is important.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
Grady?
It's Grady, Walter.
Who's this ?
Yes?
Walter?
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
As a heart attack.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Only when I'm working.
Do you get high, Sam?
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Yo, Traxler.
Taking the long way home.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Her husband.
Who's that guy?
Sick.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
I don't know. It might be...
Is it good?
Oh... yeah.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Give me a break, Grady.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Why did you come here, Grady?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
Ah, right. The book.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Where you stand?
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
Maybe I should read it.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
And?
I was thinking of you.
What made you pull out that old thing?
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
That's all right. We'll find him.
I might have his number on campus.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Just kidding.
No, the dog.
The perpetrator.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
That's weird.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Hardapple?
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
A jockey? You mean, like --
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
I haven't heard of half of those.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
Just a few then. The big ones.
There's so many...
Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
George Sanders?
No, I'm going ho --
Are you riding with me, James?
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
You want to keep him happy.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
I doubt it, darling.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
