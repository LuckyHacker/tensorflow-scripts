Get it over with...
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
I bet.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
What do you add up to here?
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
No applause!
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I'm in a hurry.
No way. I always do my own work.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
That's your problem.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
What about your wife?
That's right.
And you got him...
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
News said two persons killed.
Beynon.
Hello, McCoy.
Stay clean.
I'll take care of my end.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
What about them?
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
I get my own help.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
All it takes is a long arm.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
You gotta be kidding.
We walk.
What now?
I guess we are.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Are we going to make it?
Pull over.
How long before this car's hot?
Yeah.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
I don't know, airport I guess.
Where do we go from here?
You okay?
Just get your clothes on...
Who was it?
Come on, come on.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
You're crazy.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
So what?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
What is it?
Whatever you say.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Yeah.
I'll be ready.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Can we make it?
You and me.
Okay.
I don't see how.
Things can't get much worse can they?
You want to try with me?
Sounds good.
Whatever happens it's over.
No more about Beynon.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
I guess you're right.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
We got this far.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
I don't want to hear it.
I want to say something.
Sure...
We're going to make it.
Yeah.
We better stick here till tonight.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
No scars.
No scars?
I think so... I don't know.
Okay?
Not now.
Are you hungry?
Twenty eight hundred.
How much?
El Paso.
Where are you going?
Let's do it.
Only one car.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
You can't trust anything these days.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
I did I killed a man.
When are you going to learn?
That would be the first time.
El Paso.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
I think you liked it with him.
You're full of ifs.
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
What?
I didn't mean police.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
There may be a hunting party.
Like what?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
You've got it all figured.
When they find it, they find it.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
I mean it.
Do you mean that?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
What do you want to do?
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
When we had trouble before it was different.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
I'll bet you can.
I can handle it.
Texas is a big state.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
You bastard...
There better be a guy with the
Sure?
Fifteen minutes.
How long ago.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
He must have.
And switched keys.
A man helped me open it...
We keep going.
What do we do?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
She's on TV.
Who's she?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
You sent me to him.
Yeah.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Why didn't you tell me?
Do it my way.
I don't want to go there.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Do you trust him?
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Do it my way.
He might be ready to chop us up.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
There are three men dead.
Why?
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
They checked in.
I see it...
Doc...
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
What about the bank?
... and live happily ever after.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
I mean it.
Bullshit.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
At least you were outside.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
That bad?
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Promise you won't laugh.
My mind's not on guessing games.
You know how I feel?
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
For exits off Main Street.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Want to cry now?
I didn't. I just waited.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
That doesn't hurt.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Why are you laughing?
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
Yeah... I know.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
You got the parole, didn't you?
Is he straight?
$250,000 right off the top.
Suit yourself.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
I bought you a lot of new things.
You were asleep.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Better than I remembered.
How was it?
Really.
Really?
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
I'll be okay.
Sure.
Wait... give me a minute.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
It's just been a while.
It's all right.
I guess I'm kind of...
I'm still here, Doc.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
After four years and now the question comes up.
You go out much?
No. It's been a long time.
That's not all of it.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Boring.
Fatter... some things never change.
How's Estelle?
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
You been okay?
Just the way I remembered.
How does it taste?
Whisky and a peach.
What do you want for dinner?
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Half a million.
Good.
Assumed name... Houston.
Where did you get them developed?
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Better than old times.
Just like old times?
I've been doing my homework.
Where did you get those?
Small town, small bank, big money.
What's Beynon got set up?
I've been there every day for the last four years.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
It doesn't look like that.
I want to take a walk.
Where do you want to go?
Yeah.
Feel good?
It looks fine.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Sure...
My license expired, let's get out of here.
You want to drive?
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
You okay?
Hi.
Hello, Doc.
No way. I've got to get out now.
We'll try again.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
I never have any luck.
No, I'm afraid not.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Yeah... I guess it does.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
No, I'm not.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Where's home?
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
That's right.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Hope you get to where you're going.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Oh my God.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Might try that.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
All right. Shells?
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Can I help you?
Dillinger got killed.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
What do you have in mind?
Aren't we going a little hard?
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
Whatever you need.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'm good at that.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Wire pull over?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
What about the vault?
Two.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Suit yourself.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
What about you?
Yeah. I got out.
You were with him?
Chicago.
Where?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Can't leave the desk.
Then you do it.
He took the day off.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Right.
Just sandwiches...
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
How's Mama and the kids?
Go with God.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
How about twenty thousand?
You got it.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
That's what I want.
And I keep my mouth shut?
Sure am.
You serious?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
'Bout five thousand.
Come on. How much?
What's it to you?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
Not now.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Which way?
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Let's just get to the border.
I kinda doubt it.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Why not?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Where we go in1?
Just fine.
How was that?
Suit yourself.
Drive.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
That's what matters, isn't it?
Can he trust you?
Two years.
How long have you been married?
You can trust him...
That right?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
You do what he says, Harold.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
A Ford... We have a Ford.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
Just... tell us what you want.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
I'll tell you when.
I've got to stop.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I got a nurse in mind.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
What's the damage?
