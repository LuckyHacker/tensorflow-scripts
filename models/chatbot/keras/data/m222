My cannon.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Cannon fuse.
What the hell is that, anyway?
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
How much you think?
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
You can't fight'em that way...
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
Roger that.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Yeah, still got one poking around.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
No problem.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
Ready as we'll ever be.
You guys all set?
Some kind of mutation...?
Or a big mother slug maybe?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
I think I scared it!
Knock it off, Burt!
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Well, who put you two in charge?
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
She's got my vote.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
In a minute.
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
What the hell you doing back already?
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
You're really leaving, huh?
Howdy, Rhonda.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
Could we make it to the mountains?
So...now what?
No.  We go straight.
We're not going over there, right?
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Oh my God.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Well, we can take my truck then.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
You know, up the jeep trail.
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
I might have an idea...
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
You are so full of shit...
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
What?
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Somebody paying you to do this?
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
No ties.
Yeah...but no ties.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Road's in!
Not yet, not yet...
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
What the hell are you doing?!!
I want to live for the three days.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
Use the fucking bomb!
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Only if something happens to me.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Like hell you are.
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
We got a plan!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Its tires are flat...
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
We need another plan.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Right.
You go north, I'll go south.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Don't he have a home to go to?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Me, too.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Son of a bitch!
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
I think we wait right here.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Little sons of bitches.
Prairie dog burrow...
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
We'll take your word for it.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
You got <u>that</u> right!
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
This is one big mother!
Sons of bitches!
What the hell are they?
Oh shit!
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
<u>Why</u> would they do it?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Great.  Thank you.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
The rifle.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
A man who plans ahead.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Fuck you!
I am not!
You're hung up again.
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Val!  Val!
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Oh, Jesus!!
I'll go with that plan.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
You got that right.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
You're full of shit.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Adios, bridge!
So long, cactus!
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
That's the plan.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Well, sure.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Why?
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Do not talk to the driver.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Has a lot of rain.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Hell you did.  Your turn.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
You didn't cook breakfast?
You bet.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
We playing cards tonight?
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
How's she doing?
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
Yeah, Val.
Burt!  Heather!
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Down, honey, down.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
God, what a stink!
Come on.  Get away from it!
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
You sure this is where it was?
It's...gone...!
Well, what's wrong with it?
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
What?
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
The con...!  Oh my God.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Okay, ten dollars.
Twenty.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
And I appreciate it.
Could be.
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
LET'S DO IT!
It worked!  There they go!
Good point.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
You guys do all the odd jobs.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
They're working together, too.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
Why do you all keep asking me?
What's it doing?
It does.
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Ready?
Let's assume that it is.
Think it's still following us?
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
You okay?
Darn it!
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Around here?  Why would they?
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah, geography.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
