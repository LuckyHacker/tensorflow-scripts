You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Rocky!
Janet!
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
He might be.  I don't know.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
I was telling the truth.
I told you, my car broke down.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
On my mother's grave.
You promise you won't tell?
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
You!
Oh well.  How about you.  
Certainly not!
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Janet
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Janet.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Janet.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Janet.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I hope so my darling.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Oh don't be so shy.
No, don't do that.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
It's alright Janet.
Brad...
Weiss.
Weiss.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Oh Brad.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Right!
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Well I want to leave.
It's just a..a party Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
Oh....Say something.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Yes.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
I'm coming with you.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh...
We must have a blow-out.
What was that bang?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
For you.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Uh huh.
I've got something to say.
Yes Brad.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
Yes.
Good God.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
You know this earth - this person.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You're wet.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Hello.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You're OK by me.
A decision had to be made.
You did right.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
Makes you cry
What guy
Makes you cry
What a guy
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Promise you won't tell Brad.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
I didn't make him for you
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Dealing
Free to try and find a game
Wheeling
Like I'm outside in the rain
Feeling
Smile and that will mean I may
Oh my, my,
Want to come again and stay
Now I
Was all I had to say
Goodbye
On the day I went away.
So come up to the Lab.

My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.
That ain't no crime
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
The delivery boy.
Who's Eddie?
Oh.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Oh, lucky him.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Are you - giving a party?
You're too kind.
I think you had better both come inside.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Creature of the night.
