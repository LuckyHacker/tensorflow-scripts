Ziat!
Who?
They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Anybody bitten?
Don't make me laugh.
How's your hernia?
What?
You want to split your hernia again?
Want me to take over?
Listen!
What?
It's there!
KNOCK IT OFF!
You got that, shit face? Asina...
We go through the wall?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Tunnel?
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Years?
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
Twenty months?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Where?
Two kilos.
History, man, history. How much?
Yeah.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
The kids? Why are they...
Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
...He had a bald skull and...
'Figgers.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
Getchmis...?
Getchmis olsun
Everything.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Billy?
Shit.
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Stop shitting me, man!
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
To what?
Oh Jesus! 
DAD!
I know.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
For the money... )
Why'd you do it, Billy?
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
The Hilton.
Where you staying, Dad?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
Where'd you get that limp?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Yeah. How's Mom?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Dad...I'm...
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Where are the minefields?
How much?
I'll pay extra
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Not far. Just a little way.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Those mountains? are they?
Sixty?
Sixty Lira?
About ten kilometers.
How far?
Sure.
You know where they are?
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
Yes.  I think so.
Would you recognize him again?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Yes...?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
No, I'm not afraid.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Lucky girl.
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
...She was on the plane.
Girlfriend?
Be tough on 'em.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
What's your father do?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Got a family back there?
I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
Beats working.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
How much did you figure to make?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Something like that. Cigarette?
...are you with the Consulate?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Just what?
But just...
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
But didn't have heroin.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Stupid.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Seven years...
How long?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
Aslan, there... 
He wasn't even in the car?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
That doesn't seem so bad.
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
It's not fair!
A hundred grams.
How much did you have?
Twelve years.
What they give you?
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
And you?
What did he do?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
Feeling all right?
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Just Erich.
About as good as it looks.
How's it feel?
Billy!  Please!
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
And?
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
What do you mean?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What's wrong?
Thank you.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
Hello.
Hello, Billy.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
Why the suit?
Oh shit.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
What?
Just got some news on Bell.
His radio Back of his open, radio...
Max - where?
Hishradyo.
Yeah? Where?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
I know where it is.
What?
You know where it is?
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
It's already been cut.
I want to cut his throat.
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Whose?
Cut his fucking throat.
What?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
Oh we... we...
After we're outside the kogus?
What?
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Yeah.
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
What?  You gotta be joking.
We go back.
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Two thirty.
What time is it?
Jimmy?
Yeah!
Okay?
Yeah.
You got your stuff?
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
Where is it?
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Section 13?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
What's that?
Get the... midnight... express.
What do you mean?
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
What is it? . . . Billy?
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
No!
My passport!
Billy, what's the matter?
You're right.
You can't take anything seriously.
Never was anybody like you...
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
I think I've been poisoned.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Work, work, work, that's all do
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
That's a great philosophy.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Learn what?
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Know what?
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
You're ayip!
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
Did you ask for bail?
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
What'd the Prosecutor say?
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
Mr. Yesil.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Who got the Frenchman out?
What lawyer?
The lawyer?
Who?
His name?
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Lawyers?
