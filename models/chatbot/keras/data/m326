My brother.
My brother.
Ya back is got.
You got my back.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Talk to me.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I don't like anything else.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
Is that the only tape you got?
I be.  I'm living large.
How you be?
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
I'm gonna leave now.
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
I own a brownstone on this block.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?"
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Yes?
Yo!
Jade, I still love you.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
So, in other words, you are not down.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
Did you ask Sal?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
And?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
Have you noticed something about them?
So?
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
What did he do this time?
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
Don't come back, either.
You a troublemaker?
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
How much?
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
No, you the man.
You the man.
You the man.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
Ask Sal.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
What?
Mookie.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Squash it.
I don't know how he does it.
What can you say?
No!
No!
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
How long?
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
It's been about a year.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Make it plain.
What was you saying?
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
We're still standing.
I hope the block is still standing.
I didn't.
Where did you sleep?
I've done that before.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
Is it a good morning?
Good morning.
You're welcome.
I thank you.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
You're a drunk fool.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
That's it.
That's it?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
OK.  OK.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
C'mere, Doctor.
Gotta go.
Mookie.
You got a deal.
Fifty cents.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
What makes Sammy run?
My name is Eddie.
What makes Sammy run?
Ten.
How old are you?
Eddie Lovell.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
...peanuts.
I'm getting paid...
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
You are too crude.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
Innocent!
He's completely innocent.
Nice!
He's just being nice.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
What are you so worked up about?
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Stop tripping.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
See ya around.
I'll see you out.
I'll see ya there.
Yo, I'm gone.
No.
I'm going with you.
I'm coming.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
What responsibilities?
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Sal's gonna be mad.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I'm working.
How come you're not at Sal's?
I'm in here.
Jade.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
It's gonna be hot today.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Wake up!
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Whew!
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
And move to Long Island...
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
I'll do.
How are you holding up in this weather?
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Sorry, comb got caught.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Yeah, me too.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
This might take some time.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Jade, you're late.
Motherfucker you.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
How many you say?
D!  D!  D!  You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first.  D.
C Duracell.
D, not C.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Fuck!  My money!
WAKE UP!
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Alright.  Let me play this record while I go to work on my chicken Parmigiana hero with extra cheese and extra sauce.
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Yes you did.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
ML, hold this for me.
What?
ML?
It's a motherfucking shame.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
It's dug.
Can ya dig it?
Let it be broke.
Do I have to spell it out?
That's my name.
Sweet Dick Willie.
What is?
It's a fucking shame.
Look at that.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Don't worry about it.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
That's it?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
OK.  OK.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
C'mere, Doctor.
Gotta go.
Mookie?
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
No.  What are you gonna do?
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
Christmas came early.
You keep it.
Keep it.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
You don't know shit about shit.
Quit bullshitting.
Do we now?
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
We both do.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Sal, I want my money.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Where we goin'?
C'mon, Sal.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
No, just checking.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Here, you gotta delivery.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Tonight, when we close.
I would like to get paid now.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Can't do.
Can you pay me now?
Depends.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Run it then.
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
I got no say over people.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Talk to your son.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Hey!  What did I say?
You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life.
Later.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
I am a man.
Be a man.
Tina, I'll be right back.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Tina, it's not like that.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
To get my money.
Where are you going?
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Feels good.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
What?
Meda.  Meda.
Later for you.
It's 'pose to be cold.
It's cold.
Lie down, please.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Tina, you're sweating.
No rawness.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Why you gotta curse?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Trust me.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Trust me.
What else?
Then we'll do something else.
You a blue-moon fool.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
How long then?
I can't be staying long anyway.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can run out and get it.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I just forgot.
Your memory is really getting bad.
Shit!  I forgot.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
I've been working hard, getting paid.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Tina, you are too slick.
Come in then.
Hot.  Hot.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Do I love you?
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Before I get off work.
When?
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I work too, but I still make time.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Keep dreaming.
It's e-vit-able.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
I didn't know you could read.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Eddie Murphy.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Magic Johnson.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
You deaf or what?
Remember what I said.
What?
Smack him back.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
You talk to 'em.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
You get paid to do what we say.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Shaddup, Vito.
You're still late.
Just coolin'.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
He's right.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
We're outta here.
I'll do that.
I don't like to fight.
That's what I think.
That's what you think?
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
I don't know.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
Yeah.
Ya like him, huh?
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
That's right.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
I love you, Black.
I love you, my brother.
I understand.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
HATE!
I'm listening.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
That's the dope.
On the rebound.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I was going to buy a slice.
Whaddup.  Money?
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
I like Mookie a lot.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
So what do you want me to do?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
You really think so?
I know.
How do you know this?
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
You listening to me?
Mookie's OK.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good.  I want you to listen.
I'm listening.
I love you.
I know this.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Some are OK.
Forget it, Mookie.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Sez me.
Sez who?
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
I ain't getting shit.
Get the broom.
He's nuts.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Pop, stop lying.
'Bout time, Pop.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
I didn't think so.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Then we could try something else.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Turn it off.
Twenty minutes.  How come you niggers are so stupid?
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Pino, relax, will ya.
Tell Vito.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Hey!  Watch it.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Don't start on me today.
Take it easy, Pop.
Tell 'em, Pop.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Whaddup?
How ya doin', Mookie?
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Pop asked you.
Tell Pino.
The both of youse, shaddup.
