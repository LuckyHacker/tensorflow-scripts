Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
I worry about them.
Khambas are wild men.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Kham, Holiness.
Where are you from?
Yes, Holiness.
All quiet?
Yes. I am ready.
Please, come, Holiness.
A moment.
We must go, Holiness.
I know.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
No cried?
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
Cow.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
Tell me.
Again?
Mama, my story.
No!
Goodbye, Kundun.
Hmmm.
Can I free the prisoners?
I will buy them for you.
Here. We'll collect them.
Where will you keep them?
Will you buy the sheep for me?
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, now.
Are you? Of whom?
But, I am in charge.
No.
Can I do anything I want?
Not the way to talk to people.
It is alright, Father.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
I will not approve it.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Are you, General?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
Soon.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
I have a copy for you.
I have.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Thank you. Please sit.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
General Chiang.
Dalai Lama.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Then, we shall meet.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Yes.
Holiness?
Yes, but they say he did.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Time to study.
Yes.
He is a capable man.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
I am afraid.
With much bloodshed.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
And the United Nations? Surely?
All?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
We did not.
Did you receive the letter?
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
It is calm.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
We do not know.
Who am I?
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
This many?
Two.
How many?
I will be back in a few days.
I miss him too.
I miss my brother.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I pooped.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
Me. First break of day.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
Cow.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Your father had been very sick.
Far, far away.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Answer. 
I need to squeeze this brain.
The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
I accept it. What is suffering?
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
Not until you are eighteen.
I am him.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
Do you have money?
What do you think?
Do I have money?
You could buy them.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
I will not go.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
The people will not allow it.
They will take Lhasa next.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
I had relinquished doubt.
Did you ever doubt it?
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I am scared.
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
In the Americas.
Where is that?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
Has anyone died?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
What is the size of our army, now?
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
America, we shall see.
And, America?
Britain chooses not to.
Britain?
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Can India help us?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
Ask whatever you will.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
Look here!
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
When it is time.
Tell me.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
I do not know, Holiness.
Where is Alsace?
It is an island. American territory.
In the Pacific Ocean.
Will we ever be in war?
No. This war is almost over.
Will we be in this war?
The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
No. Not very big.
Is that big?
Roughly five thousand men.
How big is Tibet's army?
Please.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Thank you.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Please, come in, so cold.
Good day.
Good day.
Always.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
I leave tomorrow.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
You decide.
Do you think I must?
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
You will always!
Me?
But you will always be here?
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
What does the butter spot feel like?
You decide.
True.
What do you think?
Is that a true story, or pretend?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Does he have the spot?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
You have grown up very good.
We have.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
I will miss you.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
Am I running away?
No, Holiness.
You will not come?
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
But, I have no experience.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
Ahh.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
Where is Poland?
Ahh.
This is Britain.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Yes.
The Chinese.
We have enemies.
I would not know. Maybe.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
You cannot.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I want to go down there.
As you say.
Pretend.
It is a story, you decide.
Is that true or pretend?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Things change, Kundun.
I have smarter men.
I have more men.
I am braver.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
It may not be your decision to make.
How could I ever leave?
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
We cannot.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
I do.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
Eliminate you.
You, kill me?
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Tell me.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
It is a difficult situation.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
What would you do, Holiness?
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
Completely.
You are unharmed?
It is possible, Holiness.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
I see that.
Like my mother.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Much too young.
Too young?
No.
Does he treat you fairly?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Hmm.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
