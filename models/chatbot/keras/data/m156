You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
No...
Fuck that, we've got company...
Alma I told you to...
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Those ain't cops.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Tyrone...
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Uhh... I with it sister but...
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Well... is it loaded?
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Lemme see that rifle son...
What are doing with yours?.
What are you doing with the gun?
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
You got to sit on Eldridge...
You know it brother.
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
What's up?
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
What the fuck?
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Like?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Who's they?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Judge, calm down.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Yeah, it's me.
Inspector Brimmer
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
What are you crazy?
Get out of the fucking car.
What's with you?
Get out of the car.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
Yeah... whatever you say.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
I got you.
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Yeah.
So... we understand each other Judge?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Damn straight.
You know it. Stay Black...
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
You know that's bullshit.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Look this is bull...
Motherfucker... you stay away...
No Fuck you!!!
Man, fuck you!!!
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
Naw... I gotta...
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
You got it. Berkeley?
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
...Glad you came man.
No man. PE -- "political education."
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
I don't know. Look around man.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
I don't think that will be any problem...
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Rodgers... this is no good...
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Jesus...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
Are you finished?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Now hold on Rodgers...
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
You want me to put a man on it?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Can you make a deal with them?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
No sir he didn't.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Yes sir, I did.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir I was.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
You mean...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
We're working on that...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Alone...
So talk...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
C'mon let's...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
We're like policing the police.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
We need money first...
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
That's right brother... listen and learn.
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
Wait a second there brother...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Like the manual says, "Information is...
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Brimmer.
What's the pig's name?
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
What, I don't know how you mean?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
I don't know about that.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
They were empty...
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Right on Brother Judge...
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
I'm down.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
No man. Gonna walk.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Yeah... let me think about it.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
I don't know.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
So what's the deal?
We appreciate your help with this.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
Yeah.
You were. infantry right?
Later for that. I'm done either way...
We'll all get out of here together.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Motherfuckers...
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
You alright?
Shut the fuck up!!
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Bullshit...
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
What are you saying?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Fuck is up?!
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Sorry man...
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Nothing.
What's up with you?
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
If you got something to say, say it.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Huh?
Just the legit shit.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Fuck maybe... be there.
Maybe...
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Just a kid.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
And who is we?
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Well, act like it. Come on.
Yeah, I do.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
I saw... but...
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Rose?
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Ain't no one seen him.
Where is he?.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
What?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
This cool the heat off you any?
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
My Mom's at that.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
I don't know. I really don't.
You believe that?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Yeah.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Yeah... cop hit me...
You don't look alright.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
