Sure.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
How the hell did you do that?
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
What's the riddle?
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
How do you stop The Screamer?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
What do you mean?
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
Does that thing work?
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
He?
Maybe he's not dead.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Dead?
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
But how can it change every time?
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
How do you do that?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
What's the question mark?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Yeah, who isn't.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Talk to me.
Why don't we take this into my office.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
You don't like it?
It's the game, ARCADE.
Now what seems to be the problem?
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
How'd you know it was us?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
I came from the city on the left.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Did you play ARCADE last night?
What's her problem?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Sick?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
Has anyone seen Greg?
What the hell does that mean?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
What is it?
Never been on a snowboard.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
There never is.
Christ...no time...
I don't want to talk about it.
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
So that's what we almost died for?
We don't have a choice!
We can't reach that!
Screamer.
What the fuck is that?!
Look around...
What?!  There's nothing here!
Our time's up.
Check your read-out.
Shit...
There...
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Right, then...
The clock's already ticking.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Okay.  It's West.
You've got the schematics, check.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Got it.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Don't even say it.
One.  In case...
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
We're actually inside, aren't we?
You feel it?  It's different this time.
I know.  It sucks.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
What?
You don't get it, do you?
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Yes I am...
You're not coming, Alex.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
Put in a quarter.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
What are you looking for?
You didn't hear me?
Alex...
Yeah.  The Inferno.
Dante's Inferno.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Everything.
You got the schematics?
I can't believe you made it!
Jesus Christ!
Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
What are you going to do?
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
No I'm not...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
Virgin sacrifices?
I was afraid you'd say that.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
And beat it at it's own game.
You mean we learn the rules...
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
What?
SLIP-STREAM.
I don't know.
Then where do we go?!
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
The Police, then...
It's already out.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Like the fractals?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
Nick, what is it.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
What?
That's what I thought.
My house.  I want to try something.
Where do we go?
We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
We can't...
Then leave her.
What?!
Change the channel!
Let's go around back.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Laurie's.
Where to now?
She thought Benz was at school.
Well?
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
No way.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Sure.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
All of them?
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Something's happened to them.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
You imagined it.
So how did it know my name, then?
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
It is.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Happy?
Turn if off!
I'm in the middle of it...
Can you turn off the game?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Funny.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
I'm coming over.
It's twelve-thirty!
No, in person.  Now.
We are talking...
I have to talk to you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Nick...
Hey, kid.
Hello?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Yeah...
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
So where is he?
Well, it's a long story...
So how did you do it, Alex?
Hold my keys, then.
Go for it.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
And then keep on driving?
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
I'm okay.
So tell me you're okay, then.
I know.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Oh God...oh god...
It's here!!!
In this world, wrong is right!
It's the wrong way!
That way.
Which way?
Then we'll go home.
Then we'll go home?
Thought so.
Yes...
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
You have no time.
I'm thinking!
You have no time.  What is your question?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
Is that your question?
What did he do to you?
Not yet, honey...
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
Yes...but...how did you...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
But I don't understand...
Of course I am.
Mom?  You're alive...
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
Sign me up.
So what do you think?
The game will guide you.
So how do I start?
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
"Escape"?
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
That's impossible.
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
Give her a chance, will you?
So start at the beginning...
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
Can you say anything but "cool"?
Cool.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
It means she's screwed up.
