Goodnight, sweetheart.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Tell me.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
I didn't leave you.
Why did you leave me?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Why, Malcolm?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Are you calling me?
--Do I know you?
--My God.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
Wow. They called you their son.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Thanks.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
What?
And you know what else?
Really?
You were great in the play, Cole.
Maybe.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
I definitely won't.
Don't go home, okay?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I wish I were somewhere else.
I guess she did.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
You do?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You believe now?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
Just help.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
No.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
You really look better.
What happened?
No, we're not.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Yes, I am.
Are you wigging out?
Yes, it did.
Something happened, didn't it?
You believe me, right?
Yes.
Dr. Crowe?
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
You weren't a paper champion.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Don't cry.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
--What?
Don't fail me.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Soon. One week.
When?
I have to.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
I don't know, Cole.
I told you what I want.
I don't know.
What do you want more than anything?
Yes.
Can I ask you then?
Them?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes?
Never mind.
Cats?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
What?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
...No.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
How often do you see them?
They don't know they're dead?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Me too.
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Your eyes told me.
What makes you think that?
No gas... Hey, that's good.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
No.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Yes.
Dr. Crowe.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Yes.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
I forgot myself.
I didn't know you were funny.
Who me?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
What?
That isn't magic.
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
Something I want?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
Upset words.
What kind of words?
Words.
What'd you write?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
She died a long time ago.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Yeah. Sorry.
You said the "s" word.
That I'm a freak.
Know what?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Why?
I don't tell her a thing.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
You hate him?
He hates me.
He your best buddy?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Look over there.
Where should I look then, Cole?
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
You mean aneurysm.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
You want to ask me a question?
I guess they don't.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
How do you draw now?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
If it's okay with you?
I'm going to see you again, right?
That's good.
No.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.
You use needles?
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
Congratulations.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Dr. Crowe.
I forgot your name.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
What were they hiding from?
No, just one.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
Cole, please stop.
She wanted me to tell you--
I know.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
What?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Got it.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
You think I'm a freak?
...I don't know.
What are you thinking, Momma?
They talk to you?
They want me to do things for them.
You see ghosts, Cole?
Ghosts.
Dead people?
Dead people.
They?
They scare me too sometimes.
Cole, you're scaring me.
Standing next to my window.
Where is she?
Yes.
You can see her?
Oh my God.
A lady. She died.
They did?
Someone got hurt.
Yeah.
You know that accident up there?
Tell you my secrets.
Communicate?
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
I'd give anything to have been there.
Maybe.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
So who moved it?
Don't get mad.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
Anything bad about me?
Lots of things.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Oh.
They're right here.
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
Stuttering--
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley!
Who!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stop looking at me.
How did you--?
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
What--
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Excuse me?
You're a stuttering Stanley!
I don't know how else to look--
Stop it!
Like what?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
They used to hang people here.
Yes, Cole?
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Good for you.
J. C. Penny's?
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
Chuck E. who?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
It's our pleasure.
...He doesn't get invited places.
