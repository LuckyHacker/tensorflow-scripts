No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
No --
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Yes, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Dorothy!
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
No --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Oh -- all right.
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Aunt Em!
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Uhh -- yeah --
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Yes.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
You'll be hist...
From now on you'll be history
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
If any!
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Is morally, ethic'ly
If she?
If she...
To see?
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
You are?
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Who are you?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Do you presume to criticize the....
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Not so fast!  Not....
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
...resourceful!
Oh ....
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
...have you come back?
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Our echo.
Goodbye, folks!
Oh --
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Ohhh!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh ....
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
I don't believe you!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Hickory!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
This?
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Catch him, you fool!
Run, Toto, run!
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Ahh!  Ah!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
...didn't you?
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Are you ready now?
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Whenever you wish.
Oh, now?
Toto, too.
...Toto, too?
I have?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
I thought you said she was dead.
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Toto's my dog.
Oh!  Well....
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh -- 
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh, you....
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, no -- no!
...bed.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
...paper?
Has it poppies on the wall....
...room --
What's she doing now?
Uh-huh.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Me?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Oh --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Her -- her name is Emily.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
...her face is careworn.
Oh -- yes.
That's our farm!
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Oh --
No, they won't - honestly.
Aw, come, come, come --
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh --
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Yes --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Why --
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
How did you guess?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Stop her!
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
No --
Now you're seeing reason.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Look -- it ticks!
...yes.
Yes...!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
You've had plenty of time already!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
I knew you would!
Dorothy!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh --
Can't that female take no for an answer?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
And him a brain.
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
What sort of an animal is that?
And bears!
Oh --
We might.
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Oh-oh-
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh --
Oh! Oh!
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh --
Oh --!
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Well, you're perfect now.
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh --
Oh...
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My mouth -- my mouth!
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oil can....
Did you say something?
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh, my! 
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Ohhh!
They're coming back!
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Did they hurtcha?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Oh --
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Does it work?
Huh?  What'd he say?
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Oh, come on.
Because I'm still scared!
But why?  Why?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
How about a hippopotamus?
Not nobody, not nohow!
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
I'll be home in time for supper!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Who's her?  Who's her?
Hah!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Yes.
Yes -- let's run!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
The nerve.
A home --
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Oh.
...has been simply unbearable.
You're right -- I am a coward.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
No, but you tried to.
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
I have so got brains.
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
No -- No -- No -- No!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Oh -- Oh --
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Yes -- there --
Oh --
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
...along.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Yes --- there.
The other side....
Here -- here --
He said his mouth.
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Oil can what?
Yes.  Oh -- look --
What?
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oh --
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
To Oz!
To Oz?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
I don't blame you for that.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Yes -- that's true.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
They would?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Did I scare you?
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
...free!
My, it's good to be....
Ohhh --
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Ohh!
Ohhhh --
...yes.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
It's pleasant down that way, too.
...don't talk.
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
It's too late!  There they....
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
...ting the ruby slippers?
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
Leave her alone!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
It did?
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Dorothy next!
Ah --
Yeah.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Real courage. That's what we want.
Yeah!
You humbug!
This way!  Come on!
Where -- where do we go now?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Stop pushing!
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Now...
Up!
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
That's right.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Yes, you.
Yeah. Me?
And you're going to lead us.
Fine.  He's got a plan
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
What was that?
Here --   Come on.
I -- Oh --
Oh, you did it yourself!
Somebody pulled my tail.
What happened?
What's the matter?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
I don't know.
Who at?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Don't you start it, too!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Not nohow!
You don't get around us that easy!
Don't push!
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Yeah.
Where do we go now?
You don't neither --
No?  Now, wait a minute.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Yeah --
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Whozat?
Whozat?
It's a whatzis?
It's a whatzis.
Hold still - hold still --
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Imposserous!
Not even a rhinoceros?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Dorothy!
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
I haven't slept in weeks.
Oh, scared, huh?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
NO!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No, her dog!
You mean she bit you?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
... about Dorothy.
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Mr. Gale!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
...of the West.
Ohhhhhh!
Quiet!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
...junk!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
...Tin Man!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Go on!
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yeah --
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Oh, no!
No, you don't.
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
Come on, fellows!
Oh --
...to Dorothy!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
We'll get you together!
Oh, dear, dear.
Now, now, don't fret.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Well, that's you all over.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
It's a whozis?
It's a whozis.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
You know something?
Oh - look out.
Oh, did - did you see that?
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Ho -- ho --ho
Ha -- ha -- ha --
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Yes.
Let's.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Hey, Dorothy!
Emerald City!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Hurry -- hurry --
Come on -- come on --
A heart --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
To Oz!
To Oz?
We do.
That's right.
No, sir!
No, sir!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
How can I ever thank you enough?
Th.D.?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
You promised us real things -- a real...
Well --
Well, I --
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well, I --
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well, I --
What about us?
Yes.
It makes you nervous?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Help!
-- Ruined my exit!
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Stop that dog!
Yes -- ....
But I still want one.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
