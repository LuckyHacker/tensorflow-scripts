What have you done to my flat?
... And then some.
I fixed it myself.
...your ducts?
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
...ergency procedures.
Thank you.

Uh - what? - I ...

I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
... yer ducts.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
... ere please.
Sign here, please.
...sod you, stupid twit.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
...ven't you?
...sabotage!
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
...Yer nostril?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
...aven't you?
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Got there!
What have you got there?
... have a look.
I think we'd better have a look.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
... fix themselves.
Machines don't fix themselves.
...ixed itself.
...ditioning.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...elephoned sir.
You telephone, sir.
You must save the day.
What do I have to do.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
What? You mean you've got ...
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
What? How do you know my name?
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Oh, right ...
You don't have to sing it.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
It's reply paid.
Er ... Thanks ...
He will be pleased when he comes home.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Layton.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Her name is Jill.
Go away.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Beginner's luck.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
In fact, killing people -
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
No, no ... I did that...
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Help me!
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Gillian Layton?
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Well ... well, I ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Sorry ...
Well, I ...
If I can help you ...
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Thanks very much Sam.
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
Jack ...
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How could you do this to me?
What?
You stupid bastard!
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Bastard!!!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Shut up!
Jack?... Jack?
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Yes we have, Jack!
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack, she's innocent!
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
It could all be coincidental.
I do. Goodbye. 
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Trust me.
Do you know what you're doing.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
We don't make mistakes.
Say it was a mistake.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Take her off the list.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
They weren't at school with us.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
You're the only person I can trust.
And you're mine.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
So what are you going to do about her?
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Out of kindness.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Why?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
A terrorist?
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Tell me about Layton.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Very smart.
Er ... no.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
What's she done?
He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
He's a freelance subversive?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
What has Tuttle done?
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
So how ...?
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
I'm sure you have
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
You killed him?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
You got the wrong man.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Christ! You do know it all!
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
Not really, no.
Enough though, eh?
Not much.
How much do you know?
How do you mean?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Am I?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
What is it?
Layton! Oh shit!
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
What?
Ah ...
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Yes, thanks.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Are you officer 412/L?
SAM! What a surprise!
Jack!!
Mr Helpmann!
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Er, I knew you looked different.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
You remember Alison?
Hello, Jack!
Really? - God, how time flies!
Triplets.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Even later.
You are late.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
What's the matter?
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
You sound worried.
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Long time no see!
Jack!
Sam!
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
Oh.
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Ah.
You think these are tits don't you?
If you say so.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
Information Adjustments.
Where do I get it stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Stamped?
Is it stamped?
Yes.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Take care.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Don't do anything silly.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Where are you going?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Don't you like parties?
Yes.
Are you sure?
They're gone.
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
What happened to you after ...
Yes.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
No you're not!
I'm going to open it!
Oh ... Jesus!
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Leave me alone!
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Go away.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Are you still following me?
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
What?
"And your children all gone."
Shit! The house is on fire!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
We? Don't blame me!
Oh God! What have we done?
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Let go! We've got to stop!
I was right! Step on it!
Stop it ... damn you!
Turn!
Get away!
Will you please turn back.
Cut it out, Sam.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
I thought you arrested me.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
You're joking.
Security.
Who will?
They'll be there waiting.
What?
Turn around!
Every day?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Look at that - right on time.
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Well, terrorists of course.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, all wars do -
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, no system is.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
We've got both.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Suit me?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Really.
No, really.
Looking for you.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
A heavy Christmas present.
It's heavy.
What parcel?
OK. What's in the parcel?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
What's going on here?
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Where are you taking me?
What?
Where are you taking me?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Why not?
I didn't like it.
Why?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes, of course. Sorry.
It's my fucking life.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Oh, sorry.
Don't litter my cab!
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
Them?
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Please!
No.
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Who are you?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Good!
Ow! That hurt!
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Who are you? Let go!
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Are you alright?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
What! Shit!
I did it for you.
I never signed the form.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
I know that.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
What's the matter?
Damn! Blast!
Yes.
Can I forget it?
I delivered it.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
Don't mention it. See you later.
You are good to me Sam.
That's it.
Here.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Here. What do I do next?
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
What?
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
27156789/074328/K.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Next of kin!
Try next of kin.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
He is dead.
Hang on.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Tuttle?
The refund for Tuttle!
A cheque.
What a BITCH!
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
You've been promoted.
Really.
Would you really, Sam?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
But if they did promote you
Don't worry.
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Oh, good!
Information Retrieval.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
It's not our mistake!
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
Lime, I need to use your computer
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
Hey - that's my desk!
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
You haven't switched it on.
Sod it, it's broken!
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
A woman eh? I see.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
Yes.
You want to take my console into your office?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
What?
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Sam Lowry.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
How long will she he away?
I won't be held responsible.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
My mother said it would be all right.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
I'm sorry but ...
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Not now ... please
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Sam!!! 
Actually, I've decided ...
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
I want to talk to him.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Mother? Is that you?
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Mother!
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
This isn't rare!
What were we saying?
It's something for executives.
What is it?
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
You're not listening, mother.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Uh ...
Um ...
What have you done with his body?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
Mistake?
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
Er, yes ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I ... uh ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
I know, I know ...!
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Whatever happened to you?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?

I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?

Who's that?

Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Thank you, Dawson.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
But I could be anybody.
No need, sir
My I.D. cards.
No, sir.
Er, don't you want to search me?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
what? ... Oh ... 
Numero, trois.
I don't know which numero.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Are we?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What is it?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
For God's sake, what's happened?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
Who fixed your ducts?
What?
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
What is it?
Sign here please.
Emergency procedures.
What the - ? How did you - ?
We'll be back.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
But we can get one.
Not ... as such ...
Have you got one or haven't you?
Now look what you've done to him.
Fixed itself.
I mean it fixed itself.
Fixed?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Central Services.
Yes?
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
Time to go.
What do they want you or?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
No. Wait here.
Are you expecting anyone?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
Can you fix it?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
The pace?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Are you saying this is illegal?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
What?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
But ... I called Central Services.
Ha!!
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
