You're money, baby.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Shut up.
Don't do it, Mike.
Shuddup.
You should call your Grandmother.
No. Stop, come on.
Are you calling Her?
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
It didn't feel that way.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
I don't know about that.
Ever since I've known you.
You're right. I know.
You've been through worse.
I know, I know.
You have to put things in perspective.
Shit.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
Thank you, Nikki.
Nikki.
Well, thank you...?
You better pay the man.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
I'd say about two weeks.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Are you sure? Maybe...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
What's that like?
Yeah.
You're a comedian?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
...maybe...
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Thanks.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Oh... a Cavalier.
What kind of car do you drive?
I'm sorry?
What do you drive?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Mike...
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Anything.
Anything?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
To do what?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
What else?
What what? What advantages?
Like what?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
How?
It does.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
I thought I was going to die.
Yeah.
You too?
Tell me about it...
Well, I left someone very special behind.
How was it hard?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Just like that?
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Not lately.
Why? You're not a real man?
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
I like quiche.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Like the quiche?
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
I'm Mike.
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
...then ask where you met her...
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
What else is going on?
They're out of Glenlivet.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
...you might get cut out.
...and even then...
...not until you book it...
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
Oh. You know.
Charles! What's up, man?
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
...Four days..?
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
No.
You haven't told then, huh?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
My pleasure.
Hi.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
Let me just check on my boy.
What an asshole.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
He is so sweet.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
...And she's with someone else.
The poor thing. Six years?
Did you get it?
Oh my God.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Always...
I'm a comedian.
What do you guys do?
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Could you believe it?
A couple of high rollers like you?
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
Do you have anything smaller?
Sure, that'll be fine.
You want this in black chips.
Huh?
Oh... right.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
You have to lay it on the table.
Sorry?
On the table.
I understand.
Sorry, it's just that...
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
It's a rebound.
Why not?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
What do you do, Trent?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Well, who represents you back east?
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Who's your booking agent?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Why not?
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
No...
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Hi. Sorry about that.
No, no. Hold on.
I can call back...
Yeah, hold on.
Are you on the other line?
Lorraine?
Hi, Mike?
Hello?
...get the hell outta here already...
...well, it suits you...
...The red piece of shit over there...
...Which one...?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
...It's really getting late.
Well, I should be getting...
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
It's not going to well?
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Yeah. And an actor.
You're a comedian?
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
I'll be around.
I would love to see you again sometime.
Me too.
Listen. I had a great time.
Well... This is it.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Goodbye. I lov... 
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I heard you might be moving back...
Hi.
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
...the Michelin commercial...
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Why didn't you call?
I miss you, Mike.
Really?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I thought you met someone else.
You know, us.
What kind of things?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Good.  I think about things.
Fine... I guess. You?
How are you doing?
...Six months.
How's it going? It's been a while...
You always know the right thing to say.
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Sure.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
You miss the pain?
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Then why won't she call...?
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
I didn't make it...
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
They turned you down?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
Well, you're doing so well...
What's dumb about it?
Well, that's dumb.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
She wasn't your type anyway.
I'm such an asshole.
Oh boy.
Uuuuugh!
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
What's the point?
You want to talk about it?
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
No. Just O.J.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Thanks, man.
I'll be your winger.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Go for it, man.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
I got to at least try once.
It's unbelievable.
There are so many beautiful women here.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
Him?
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Oh, like that song...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Well, let's hit that party.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
...yeah, a month ago.
I just tested for one...
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
There's the rub.
Ah, there's the rub...
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Darwinism at its best.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
Bud.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Classy.
Kinda money, huh?
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Sounds more like Aids...
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
That doesn't sound too good for business.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Oh.  Where is this place?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
An eight.
What'd you get?
I'll give you an eight. 
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
How many strokes?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
I do. Good for you, man.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I didn't mention her once today.
Oh no?
I don't talk about her that much.
Kinda.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Why?
I didn't want to say anything.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
What do you want? You're tall.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
It's definitely a step back for me.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
I mean, I need the money.
It's a gig.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
No problem.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
There's the rub.
There's the rub.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Unless she comes back first.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Right... or more likely the opposite.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
It sucks.
Well that sucks.
Right.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
So what's the difference?
Right.
So I don't call either way.
Right.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
You don't call.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
She's really special, guys.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
What are they doing here?
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
You live in such a fantasy world...
...People get carjacked...
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
You asshole.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
She was cute.
I can't believe you.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
Rejected?
Not well.
How's it going for you two?
Damned if I know...
Who threw this party, anyway?
...He's derivative...
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
He's trying to be an actor.
What's he do?
So, what? Eleven?
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
Pause it. 
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Make someone bleed.
It's kinda money, actually.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
You little bitch!
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Don't call me ever again.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Mike?
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hang on, Voltaire.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
That's right.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Are you ready to order?
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
It's not like that...
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
What the fuck..?
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
So, two days?
No...
Tomorrow?
A day.
How long do I wait to call?
No, baby!
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
We're not messing with you...
Please, don't mess with me right now...
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
What a surprise.
We got the digits, baby.
That doesn't matter.
She didn't see.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Was I money?
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
I'm sorry.
She didn't notice.
You looked right at her, baby.
What?
What are you doing?
Minnie Pearl.
Which one?
It's on.
How you guys doing?
...It looked money.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
...through the kitchen...
...the Copa, in New York...
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
Yeah. You met him once.
Who? Rob?
It starts at eight...
What time's this party tonight?
Aww... He got away?
You guys are such assholes.
Yeah.
No.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
No. Doesn't that suck?
This version doesn't have fighting?
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
I hear she's getting real fat.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
What?!?
He drives a carriage.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
Selling scrap metal.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
...a day...
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Don't remind me.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
I just need some time...
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
How?
That was different.
Michelle went for you, right.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
Yeah, a good friend.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I don't think so.
She thought you were money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
No, baby. You're money.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
She was hot.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Christy was nice...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Sorry about interrupting...
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Hold on.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
I gotta use the phone.
What?
No, man. I need to use the phone.
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
...So give me the fuckin part...
I'm telling you!
No! Not the camera guy!
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Yes!
No!
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
What was the part?
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Whatever.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Baby, we're money.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
...Baby...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Baby, you did fine.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Nice, baby.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
I know. I know.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
...gotta...
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
That's bullshit.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
I don't know...
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
She likes you.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
You think so?
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
I don't think so.
I know she's coming back.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She smiled, baby.
That was so demeaning...
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
What an asshole.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
Mikey's the big winner.
Who's the big winner?
Let's go.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's just leave.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Yea, how much?
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Thanks for clarifying that.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Always.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always, baby.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
You gotta do it.
I know, but...
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
What?!?
Double down.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
You think they're watching?
That's where we make our scene.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
It doesn't matter...
Did she, or did she not smile?
That's not cool.
She smiled baby.
Cut that shit out.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
They're all skanks.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
Whu?
Wake up, baby.
Vegas.
Vegas.
Vegas!
Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
What?
Wait.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
I'm not going to Vegas.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
You're crazy.
Tonight, baby.
When?
We're going to Vegas.
What Vegas?
VEGAS.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
I don't know...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
I don't know...
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
S'up Trent?
Hello?
Our little baby's growing up...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
...just be smart about it.
...Okay, two...
You don't have to wait three days...
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
Be smart about it.
The bear's got his claws back.
...Definitely...
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Sorry man.
...it is so on.
It is on.
...it's definitely on.
It's on.
...it's on.
It's on...
Sue!
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...Shut up, Sue...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...Sue...
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...Anaheim...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
You dick.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Yeah.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
You're money.
Now go over there and get those digits.
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...you're money...
...honestly...
...you're like a big bear.
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...You're just poking at it...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...shivering...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...we're not...
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
True.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...double diamond...
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
You think?
It's on.
What was cold about it?
That was pretty cold, dude.
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
Yes she did.
See, baby?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
Is she looking now?
No.
Now?
No.
Is she looking at me, baby?
...It's on.
Oh, it's on, baby...
...How novel.
What a surprise...
...Is he brown?
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
They're a finesse team...
...against the computer.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Because he's a bitch.
Chelios to Roenick...!
Bitch... You little bitch!
I'll be back with the coffee.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
And you?
Six.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
