I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
He's drowning me!
Okay.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Yes please!
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Oh, it was.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Shut up.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
I don't like you.
Marge, you like everybody.
No, I like him.
You'd say if you mind?
Okay, darling.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
It's vile.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
Did you speak to my father?
I'll come down.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Hi Tom.
I don't get it.
Uncanny!
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
What? What?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Shut up!
Is that good?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
We?
Well, we ate everything without you.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
You just woke up!
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Sure. Any time.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
What are you doing in Mongi?
How do you do.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
What evening?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What?
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Tom, I don't love you.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
I love Marge.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
How?
How?
Marge and I are getting married.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Oh God, I don't think so.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Really? To Italy?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
So tell me.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
So cool.
What?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Ha.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Why?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Ripley's plans.
I've got plans!
That's good.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
What are you talking about?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
He's downstairs.
Is Freddie here?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
I thought you'd missed the train.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Shoes too?
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
What club?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Freddie?
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Relax.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
What does he say?
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
I didn't mean with you in it.
No!
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Do you have any brothers?
Well we certainly know that's true.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
I know. I write like a child.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
No! I've got more than one shirt!
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
Copy out from here...
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I played piano in a few places.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
You're breaking my ribs!
What?
You're breaking my ribs!
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
And Rome.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
I have to go to Venice.
Sure. I love Venice.
Could we sail to Venice?
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
Your parents met her.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
This is so good of you.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Good afternoon!
Bird!
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
I love jazz.
You like jazz!
Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I'm never going back!
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
What?
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
Marge! You've got to hear this!
I met him in New York.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
What? What's this?
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Sure.
Can you mix a martini?
I'm intruding.
No, still here.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
That's funny.
You know, a primer.
Say again?
It's just an undercoat. 
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Who's this?
Aye, aye.
Marge-maintenance.
What are you doing?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Sure.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Frederico!
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Have you done something to your hair?
Hardly.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
You should watch that!
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
What about Christmas?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
I guess.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Who is it?
Dickie?
Hello?
No, he should talk to you alone.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Tom.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
I think it might hurt her to know.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
Yes it is.
Far cry from New York.
I'm well, thank you.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Mr Greenleaf.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Such as?
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I just don't believe that!
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
I'm sure we've met.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
I hope she never knows.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Okay.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Oh Marge.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
What?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
What are you going to do now, Tom?
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
It's all true.
I don't believe you.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Why? When?
I told you. He gave them to me.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
Marge? Where are you going?
Shut up! Shut up!
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I can explain.
You've got Dickie's rings.
What?
I found Dickie's rings.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Tom?
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
He's having an early night.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
And you, sir? Any better?
Very.
To the manner born.
Look at me what?
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
That's a terrific idea.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Tom.
Hello Marge!
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Where does Dickie live?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
What?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Dickie?
Dickie did it.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Did he kill Freddie?
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
You were going to Venice.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Is he really not here?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Oh my God. Tom.
I think you're right.
He hates being confronted.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
How long's he staying for?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
What does that mean?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Ha. Did he say why?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Where's Dickie?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Hello Marge.
I'll go.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Dickie!
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
What about Cortina?
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
So I'm learning.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Sure.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
My fiancée.
Frances?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
It's superb.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
That ring's so great. The green one.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Bird. That's jazz.
I never said that!
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
What's going on?
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
How would you know that?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
I told you! I knew it!
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
What's funny?
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
This is spectacular.
Golly. Who's paying for this?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Is this you?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Where's Dickie's father?
I think we sort of found each other.
So you found Peter...
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
I hope so.
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Do you know Tom?
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
No glasses.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
You know what -- I am.
So -- are you travelling under R?
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You're kidding.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
I've thought about you.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
What?
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Hello Meredith.
Dickie, my God!
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Beating you away.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Okay then, you're crazy.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's go.
I'll take them both.
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
I know.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
How did you know that?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
What?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Right.
Randall.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
As in the...?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Which is?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Hello.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
Excuse me?
What's your secret?
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Hmm. C'e questa... 
A ragione. A ragione. 
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Where have you been since then?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
...Tom is a mystery...
You're such a liar...
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
And don't forget. I have the key.
Peter, I... I...
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Why lie?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Was who Meredith?
Was that Meredith?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
How was it?
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Hello. What are you up to?
Nothing.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
I give up.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom, are you okay?
Or I could come back.
It's okay.
Do you want me to stick around?
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
I'll fix some drinks.
Not guilty.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
No key, huh?
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
He's already angry, I don't think --
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
He says so many fiancées.
What did he say?
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
No.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
I've been backpacking.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
That's good, isn't it?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
It's okay.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
What rumour?
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
My God.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
We'll be there.
Ten thirty?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
And tomorrow?
I can't later.
Will we see you later?
Thanks.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Ditto.
Tomorrow.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Absolutely.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
You have, yes.
I have!
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
It is a little coarse, yes.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Thank you.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
31 people.
31 people.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
No!
Does he stay with you here?
A few days ago.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
I don't remember the exact date.
November 7th is my information.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November, I thought.
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
What about Ripley?
What about Thomas Ripley?
Even her.
Even your fiancée...?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Of course. What happened to your face?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
No.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Postmortem?
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
Yes?
Dickie Greenleaf?
