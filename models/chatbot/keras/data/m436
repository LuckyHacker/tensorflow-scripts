This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...

No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Should I wear it?
That's it.

Just two. So far.							  *
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Why?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.

Couple days.
How long have I been here?

My wife.
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation.

* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Why not?
They're not looking for him.
Can I ask you something?

That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Calm down.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Don't talk about my wife.
That's different.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
How?
Help me.
I'm not.
Don't protect him.
Neither do I.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
What happened?
I have this condition -
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
What's this all about?
No!
Did you?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
What does he want?
Calls himself Dodd.
Who?
Somebody's come. Already.
What's wrong?
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Why would you do that?
I told him about your car.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Yeah, I hated it.
Yeah?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
And? 
I'll go see him.
What are you gonna do?
Where is he?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
And what did he say?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Who?
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
Kill him.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Who did he go to meet?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What happened?
His name was Jimmy.
Just relax.
It's not easy to be calm when -
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Your wife?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Such as?
There are things you know for sure.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
Course not.
Kill him.
What?
Did you?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Yes.
So I just take your word?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
How do I know he did that to you?
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Yeah. You?
Sleep okay?
You know what we have in common?
Don't remember.

Sorry.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?

You told me.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
You did explain, Lenny.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You don't remember me.
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
Thank you.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
Then why are you here?
I'm not appealing the decision.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -

Sammy was a con man. A faker.

What the fuck are you talking about?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?

From who?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
What do you mean "bad news"?
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
Why's that?
Who's she?

Natalie who?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
So what are you gonna do now?

Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
So was he scared?
Give me your keys.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Shut it, Teddy.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Fucking hope not.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
I don't know.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
We've got to get him out of here.
Why?
Natalie? Natalie who?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I don't think so.
No! Should I?
You don't know him?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Why are you here?
Probably left it in your room.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
You're living.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
You really want to find this guy?
Why?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Why?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Who?
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
