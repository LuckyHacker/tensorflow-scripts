Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Then what do I do?
There ain't.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
Aw, Baby.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
You still know.
Was a time I knew what was.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Not like He punished me.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You saying nothing counts?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
I likes yellow.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
That's the last thing they took from me.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
Say the Word!
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Well what?
Well?
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Here, let me carry that.
Folks come. Folks go.
Folks came.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
You remember Halle.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
No. Sorry.
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
THE WHITEFOLK?
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
YOU HURT ME.
and she is mine...
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
I want somethin' sweet.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Baby, don't be like that.
You don't sit with me!!
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
WILL YOU STAY?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YES.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
I will.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Thank you.
Well, good luck with the job.
Yes sir
You grown.
I don't. I have my own.
Well, if you want my opinion...
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
She gone like they say?
Yes?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Your mother all right?
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
You on your way home?
Don't pay to complain.
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
They good whitefolks?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
In case of what?
Be here. In case.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Ya think?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
I miss her.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Yes ma'am.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
Yes ma'am..
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
What you want'em for?
Oh.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
What you want?
May I come in?
Yes?
No..No that won't do...
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Extra?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Well, what can you do?
No. I mean work work.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Mama?
No...no...no..
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
She likes this dress...
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Mama let me help you.
Go upstairs I said!!
But mama..
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
MAMA!
Morning, ma'am.
Morning.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Won't you be late for work?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
No, let her rest.
Should I wake her?
That was fun.
Could be that fall you took.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Back stiff?
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
That's so.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
He knew Baby Suggs?
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
You?
I run him off.
What run him off? Tell me that!
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
Ella.
Till she showed herself.
You was friends.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Aw, no, Ella.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Her who?
It's her, ain't it?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
I don't know him that well.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
He ask, I give him anything.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
The church!
He's sleeping in the church.
Can't locate him.
Better ask Paul D.
True.
Might see anything at all at 124.
I know what I see.
You sure?
I know Denver.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Out where?
Oh I been out.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
All he can. All he can.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Who is she? Where she come from?
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She was only-
Leave off..
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
You don't know what I think.
It ain't what you think.
Jesus.
What yard? When who-
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
I don't want to know.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
I don't believe that. I won't.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
No use thinking these things now.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Never found out.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
You planning to do anything about it?
Just me.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
For what?
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
She was my best thing.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
She left me. She's gone again.
What, baby?
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
You got to get up from here, girl.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
No, You looking good.
Yeah. Look bad?
You shaved.
Paul D.
Sethe?
Yeah. Too sweet. 
Make it the way I always do.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Yes sir.
Hey!!
