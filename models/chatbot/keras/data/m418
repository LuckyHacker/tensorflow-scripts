You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
No.  Do you?
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Oh, yes.
You killed him.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
Go ahead.
I'll sue you.
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
I haven't broken any laws.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Go!!!
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
I might get a shot.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
I need to see his habitat.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
Why are we landing?
It happens when I land.
It seems like we're getting lower.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
Thank you.
You're a beautiful woman.
I don't know!
Where is he?!
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
No!
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
So profound and fat.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Then do it!!
I can arrest you!!
Raincheck.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
It came from across the lake.
What's that?
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Promise you won't kill me, first.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
This is a setback.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
His head was just... bitten off.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Yup.
Was he a good man?
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Is this a trick?
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
No crocodile has ever--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
This could end up saving your life,--
I coulda shot you, you--
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
A spring trap!
I'm laying a spring trap!
You're crawling around like a--
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Jesus Christ!!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
And you like me.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
No!!  Out!
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Cocktail?
We are here on official business.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
Keystone what?
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
We'd only just met.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Around here.  Yeah.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
And what would he do come winter?
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
Mr. Cyr!
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Just those two.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
You talk to Bickerman?
You take care.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Where is he?
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
Thank you, Jack.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Where?  Where?
You do?
I got something on the screen.
We're ready.
You ready on shore?
The more he thrashes, the better.
Right.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
That's actually the easy part.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
We both know what they'll do.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
No way.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
Hey!!
Bastard bit my chopper.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Get the gun.
He never said "go".
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
At school they'd always say "go" first.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
He's gonna live?
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
Guess I finally got bit.
You're gonna be okay.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
I'm okay.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
And how would we neutralize him?
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
They could try to tranq him on land.
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Could we have intercourse?
What?
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Eh.  Fuck it.
No.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
Oh, bullshit.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
With crocodiles... everything's even.
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
Excuse me?
Nothing's real.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
<u>Jack</u>!
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
Are you sure?
He was an Indo-pacific.
As if.  Will you miss me?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
I'm just saying last resort.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Such the flirt.
What's going on?
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
<u>Hector</u>.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
I never had sex with you!
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
That hurt my feelings.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Good thinking.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Probably not.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
You think?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
No.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Different worlds, Jack.
Likewise.
It was... something meeting you.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
Yeah.
If I'm ever in New York...
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
You sure?  I don't mind...
You wanna ride in my truck?
Well...
He heeds a tourniquet.
Get him onto shore.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
We gotta get to Hector!!
Take him.
Hector!!
Keep firing!
Watch out!!
You wouldn't?
He's mooing.
Hector.
He's floating.  Take it home.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He looks like a giant tea bag.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
It can't work.
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
Well...
Are we crazy?
Good idea.
We might as well pack.
Okay.
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
Alright, Jack!
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Look.
What?
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
You calm down!
Calm down.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Really--
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
You're mushing it a little around the--
I'm not mushing it.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Thing we can lift it?
I heard something.
What?
Ssssh!
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Well.  Goodnight.
Night.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Thank you.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
No thanks.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
It's okay.
Sorry.
Let's get away from the shore.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Like little children.  You okay?
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Just forget it.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I didn't say it like that.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
What are you talking about?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Excuse me?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
That's probably good.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
You okay?  Kelly?
Good luck.
Good.  See ya soon.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
He thinks they're what?
'Night.
Good.
Okay.  We're up at six.
I'm sorry but you're...
That was an awful thing to say to me.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
You flew up here because your boss--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
It's too dangerous for--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I beg your pardon?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
What are you doing?
I'd be able to see something.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Baby crocs?
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
In Maine?
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
Who?
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
What?
Oh my God.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
I'm not making it up.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
So I don't like tents, why--
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
I <u>told</u> you.
Why are you here?  Really.
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
Never been to Maine before?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
How big do the bears get?
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Kelly Scott.
You too.
Thanks for your help.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
He's done.  He's dying.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
I'll take it!
If you get a safe shot...
Where is he?!
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
Other than to eat us?
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Now I'm gonna puke.
So does he.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
Obviously I was wrong!
You said nobody came in here!
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
They look like they're jumping.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Are they feeding?
White perch.
What's that?
I'll call the coroner.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
Let's go.
I'm ready when you are.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
We set?
I guess.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Wait.
Should I?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Did you get him?
That it's about to go wrong.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
They're coming right in.
She's worried about the cow now.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Look ten feet into the water.
What?
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Look.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
He said he knew Karate!
Hank!
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Are you okay?
Yes.
Hank?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Are you alright?
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
What was that?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
What is this?
You think Jack's handsome?
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Hector thinks you like him.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
You like Jack?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
I asked you to be nice to him.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
I'm sorry.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
<u>Apologize</u>?
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
They don't believe her.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
With what?
I just let go of it.
You threw it at me!!
Hey!!
It looks like a branch.
I thought I saw...
What?
What the hell?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
Gee.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
Sheriff.
Was he swallowed?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
It's just that--
You're sort of a rude person.
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
I got nothing against--
You have a thing against museums?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
What?
<u>We</u>?
What kind of backup do we have?
Not yet.
You talk to the married couple?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Yes.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Seconds.  Three, four.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
I can look at dead things.
This is a little different.
Well.  At wakes.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
I'm fine, thank you.
I wouldn't.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Is the dead guy in there?
Yes.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Did he say anything?
He just came up screaming.
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
<u>Kelly</u>--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
It has nothing to do with--
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
I'm not even a field person.
Part of our research--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Kelly--
Are you on drugs?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
This is what we do?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Sorry?
I want you to go there.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
A tooth?
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Hey.
Yes, well...  famished.
It's ten after nine.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A jerk.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
Else.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
The somebody else part?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
That's not what you came to say.
Me too.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Absolutely.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
Kevin, hey.
Kelly.
I really... I should get back.
Shitbutt?
Myra.
Liar?
No.
Backstabber?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Kelly--
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
You and Kevin.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
<u>You</u>?
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<u>You</u>?
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
Kevin told me you were upset.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Wild guess.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
