I said NO!
Well, I can help.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I don't mind waiting.
Why are there two deeds here?
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
I simply can not stand that tone!
Oh Jesus.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
SO!
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
It's not that long.
Well, that's a long time.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
No. You can have them.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Aw, Betty.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
No.
No treasure maps, huh?
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
How bizarre!
I know. I don't understand it either.
Eeeww!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
You're right -- that is sick.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Carolyn!
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Did we want to?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Was this during Betty?
Nobody did.
I never knew that.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Not yet. You want to go?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
I bet mom could've helped her.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Bar across the street.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Then why do you?
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Well, I'd like to read them.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
What are you doing?
That's it!
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Grateful!?
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
I can't believe she's making jokes.
No, I don't think so. I --
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Don't say that!
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
'82.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
What?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
What's he saying now?
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Come here a minute.
What?!
Michael.
Yeah.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
What problem?
Well, there's a problem.
I thought everything WAS arranged.
He's not coming.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Lawyer here?
Mom's orders.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
She changed.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
She used to be so friendly.
Oh, yes.
She's changed.
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
No, what?
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
I'll get right on it.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Heat is heat.
Not this kind of heat.
They got heat in Michigan.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Oh, that'll be nice.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
You want me to call the doctor?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Madge?
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
No. Don't do this.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I don't know. Please...
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
But now that you have it -
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
Yeah. It could get better.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
What about us? What about me?
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
Then he can move! People move!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
For who?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
What makes it different, Robert?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
WHY?
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
No one's asking you to!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
STOP IT!
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
What do you want me to say?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
Stop it!
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
How do you know what I experience?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
What are you doing?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
Well, what is this?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
I... What do you want?
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
What?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Yes, thanks.
Sleep all right?
No.
Am I too heavy for you?
Long day. Go to sleep.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Where was she?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Uh-huh. And?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
You're somewhere else, where?
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
What?
I can't do this, honey.
What were your parents like?
I had a temper.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Trouble. Why?
What were you like when you were younger?
No, I don't mind.
But you don't mind.
Because I already tried once.
Why do you say that?
No. I couldn't.
I bet you could do a book.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
Near the church.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
I sat outside and had coffee.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Nobody's asking you to.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Why?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Yes.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
How about Bari?
Yes.
How about Italy?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
What?
Take me somewhere.
No.
Are you hungry?
You want to eat something?
No. I can't. Not yet.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes, that'd be nice.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Sure.
How about if I set the table?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Can I help?
Couple. Want to help?
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Oh, how is he?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
I want you to come.
Yeah?
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
I think he's running for town crier next year.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Oh.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
It's Robert.
Yeah. See you later.
Okay. See you later.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I'll pick you up.
Oh, sure. Great.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Wonderful. Uh...
I would love to come for dinner.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
No. I was just... No.
Am I interrupting anything?
Yes! Hi.
Francesca?
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
I already apologized.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
What made you ask such a question?
My mistake. I apologize.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
No, I'm just saying --
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
But it's not the same.
No. But I love them just the same.
But no one in particular.
I told you, I love other people.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
No.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Why doesn't it scare you?
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
You really don't need anyone?
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
Woman friends, too?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
You must get lonely at times.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
So what happened?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
What?
Francesca?
Yes.
Are you all right?
What?
Francesca?
No. I'll do them later.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
What?
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
No. I'm all right. It's working.
You want to go back in?
When?
You get used to it.
Smells like dirt.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
You drink bug repellent?
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
I'm sorry. That was...
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
Do you miss it?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Why did you stop?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
And did you?
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
I don't think you're normal.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
You sound like an artist.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Why, do you think?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
You ought to write these stories down.
Oh you!
We got engaged.
Then what happened?
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
She starts sniffing me.
What?
Okay.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Help cook?
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
But I... We don't even know each other.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
I feel so embarrassed.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
I think so.
Is the dizziness gone?
Much.
Feeling better?
Yes. Very clean.
And clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Clean?
He's very... clean.
What's he like?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Why?
I doubt that.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
Must be nice having kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
No, your kids.
About a year and a half.
Oh. How old?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
And how long are you here for?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Where are you staying while you're here?
I thought it was funny.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Not at all.
Mind if I smoke?
Sure.
Lemon?
Francesca. Robert.
Francesca.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Sure.
Want another cigarette?
Oh, that's nice.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
WHAT!
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Oh! You caught me.
Oh there you are.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
This time of year.
I don't mind waiting.
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Yeah.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
So, how long you've been living here?
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
No, really?
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
How long you been married?
Oh.
After the divorce.
Oh. When did you move back?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Are you from Washington originally?
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Maybe it's because I live here.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
No.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Hmm-mmm.
Pretty country.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
That's it.
Roseman Bridge?
Yeah.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
What about your husband?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Yes. And I've accepted.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
Hmm?
Franny?
Okay.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Want anything special for dinner?
It's only four days.
I'm going to miss you.
I'm positive.
Frannie.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I can't sleep.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Where you going?
Later. Go back to sleep.
What time is it?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
'Bout 4:30.
Sure.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
You feeling better Franny?
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Okay.
What's she like?
Betty.
What's her name?
Okay.
Nah.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Yes, they are.
They're not going to find her!
About an hour ago.
I don't remember!
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
What happened?
Oh my God...!
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
WHAT!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Apparently just before her death.
When did she decide this?
Cremated?!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
