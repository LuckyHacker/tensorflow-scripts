Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Stick with Carla.
Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Could we change the subject?
You know how I feel about what you do.
Not really.
You want to talk about it?
Had a close one.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
He's got a gun, sir.
Don't let him do that.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
It's me sir.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Spit it out.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Thank you.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
Maybe.  Not really.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
No.
What's that?  Mason?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
God's speed.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
I'm not a fool, Billy.
You knew?  All this time?
Womack ripped it up, right?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Partners.
Partners?
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Surprise, surprise.
The cell, Mason.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
It's about time.
Mason.  Mason?
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
Wait.
Now they only have three rockets left.
What are you doing?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
What, vou?
Wrong.
I'll go.
It's all I could think of.
Limp dick?
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Wait.  Where're you going?
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
Motor oil?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Yes.  You'll be outside.
You suppose?
Well yes I suppose ...
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
I don't understand....
Tell me what you really do.
I'm a field agent.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
