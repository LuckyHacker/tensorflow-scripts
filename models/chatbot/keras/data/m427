When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
What are you talking about?
It mattered, Mom.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
That's ridiculous.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
I don't remember that.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
That's not it.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
No I don't.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
There you go.
Don't curse.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Whatever.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
So what do I do?
Maybe she is.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Yeah, you met her?
To that stewardess?
Engaged.
How is he?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
I can manage.
Need any help?
Hi.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
What?
He's still at the bank.
Dad around?
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
What?
Nothing.  So good luck.
What?
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Child, take a bite.
I can't eat before a game.
Taste this.
Watch your mouth.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
That's not funny
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
nothing.
Pants.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
I hate it.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Ah, Mom.
Oh, all that work.
Nothing.
Monica, what did you do?
Thanks, sweetheart.
Okay.
You sure?
The blue.
Which one for tomorrow?
Camille, she'll be fine.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
She's alright.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Okay.
He's fine.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
So you're still breast-feeding?
What'd you do?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
But you use potato?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
Are you okay?
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Really?  Well, come on, then.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
You're a caterer?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
Okay?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
What?
You want the job or not?
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
Thanks.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
Coach...
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
What?
This time get your feet set.
I can take it.
Shh.  It's okay.
Wait...
Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
Uh-huh.
That was nice.
Then I'll get you some punch.
My mouth is kinda dry.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Sorry.
That was two words.
Huh?
Careful.
Sort of.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Oh, sorry.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
You're cold?
Can I take your coat?
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
A horse?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
I don't know sometimes.
To do what you love.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
You might be the only one with a job.
Why not?
Nah.
Four days.
So how long is this trip?
Get used to it, babe.
I don't wanna see that.
What?
Damn, girl.
Yes, we appreciate that.
It means a lot that you came by.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Hello.
Why are you up?  Get in bed.
It's okay.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
They ever love you back?
Too many times.
You ever been in love?
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
Yeah, right.
You do.
Oh, great.
I told him you looked like me.
How'd you get him to say yes?
And he's fine, girl.
He's in college?
This brother from my college.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
No.
Mom tell you to do this?
I know...
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I found you someone.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
No one's forcing her.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Mom's going to hate it.
No.
That too tight?
I'll take that as a compliment.
You shoot like a girl.
So how's the job going?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Hey, munchkin.
Chances are there's still a chance.
I know.  But chances are...
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
What?
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
I was just showing emotion.
You lost your head.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
You ever think about going back?
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
Just not my type, I guess.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
I wouldn't know.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
How's that been?
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Just like that?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
What's up, Sidra.
Well, what do you know.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
What's that?
Just one word of advice for next season.
I know.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Thanks.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
But?
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up?
Didn't have to try very hard.
You were trying to make me look bad.
I was just playing ball.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Thanks, Sidra.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
What's up with that?
She hates all freshmen.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
And what happens when you lose?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
So?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
What will this prove?
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
So you're gonna bitch up?
You're out of your mind.
Your heart.
For what?
One game.  One-on-one.
What?
I'll play you.
Wrong.
Better late than never, right?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Then why are you so upset?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
I heard enough.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
you woke me up to tell me that?
From basketball.
What?
You asked me what was missing.
We need to talk.
What's going on?
Find.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
What?
Something was just missing.
Cause I don't get it.
Why do you keep asking me that?
So why'd you give up ball?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Wow.
Maybe go back to school.
Like what?
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
You're serious.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
It just isn't.
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Getting there.
So...how's the knee?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
You visiting?
Thanks.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
No.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
A rest?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
What do you mean?
Actually, I don't...
Figured it was something like that.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Oh yeah?
Tried calling you a couple times.
Kiss my ass.
Funny.  I never did.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
We won the championship.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
I forgot, "Q-man."
Not for Quincy McCall.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
What are the doctors saying?
Yup.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Thanks.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Just something I'm trying.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Uh huh.
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Few days ago.
When did you decide all this?
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
You're what?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
You don't think so?
I don't think so.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
What?
I'm not asking for us to be together.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Never had to.
I never asked you to choose.
Least you got your priorities straight.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Stay!
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
You forgot to be there.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Least she had time for me.
Cheap date.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Can we talk?
Are you out of your mind?
We're going to get some food.
What the hell's going on?
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Woman...
The "man" again.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
You weren't at my game.
Hey, what's up.
Hey.
Nah.  I have curfew.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Not really.
You want to go talk?
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Who's nobody?
Nobody.
Who was that?
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
he's just playing, Q...
It happens, right...
Sorry about your game.
Here I am.
I've been trying to find you all day.
What's up?
Hey.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
Quincy...
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
Why not?
I...can't.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
You're not stupid.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
She understands.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
I wanted you to.
I won.
Right here.
Yo, where's the "D"?
Plan to.
Kiss my booty.
My court, I go first.
Give me the ball.
What?
Clothes.
What are we playing for?
So how about a little one-on-one?
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
That was so weak.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Then prove her wrong.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Forget Tonya Randall.
Quit.
It's okay, little baby.
I said fine.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Fine, Quincy.
I can't be nice to a fan?
You do see me standing here, right?
What?
Whatever, big head.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
What'd it say?
Yeah.
You finish the reading for E-con?
I know, right?
What was that about?
You sure?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
When'd you get this?
You had four offensive rebounds.
What?
Four.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Why?
That what you think?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
None of your business.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Figures.
Mulholland Drive.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Early night for you, isn't it?
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Guess not.
He ain't Spalding.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Yeah.
You having fun?
Hey.
Hey.
You either.
You don't look half-bad.
Yeah.
See you made it.
Good.
I don't.
Didn't know you cared so much.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Would you watch the damn road?
That's it, give it your best shot.
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
God, here we go.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Your hot-ass temper.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Who's Spalding?
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
I don't.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
So she's honest.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
And?
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Big-ass titties?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
What's that?
Please.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Your legs don't look broke.
A ride home.
I know this.  What do you want?
Way to hoop.
Shut up!
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
What?
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
I don't have to do what you say.
So that means I have to ride with you.
So?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
I want to ride my own bike.
Five seconds.
For how long?
I think we gotta kiss now.
Okay.
Kay.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Oh.
I don't like flowers.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
What do I have to do?
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I don't care.
You do act different.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don't know.  A lot.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
He works at a bank.
Your Dad play?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
I never knew a girl that could play.
I just can.
So how come you could play basketball?
Uh huh.
For real?
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
So...does it hurt?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
Lucky.
One, up.
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Give it yourself.
Well, can you give him this for me?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
No.
Your hair looks so cute like that.
Hey.
Hey, girl.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
He tore his ACL.
Nona, please.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What's that, not great?
Not great.
Keep your voice down.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
I have.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Yeah.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
At one in the morning?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
Business folks.
With who?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
We should head over.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Zeke.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Quincy, please...
This is just about money, you know that.
Just...leave it alone.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Guess he talked to you.
I'm fine.
Sorry.  You okay?
You scared me.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Later when?
Said he'd be home later.
Where's your dad?
Yup.
Still the man.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
How was your game?
I've been hearing you.
You hearing me?
Okay.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
We were just studying.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
What are you doing in my room?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Uh, your earring?
What is this?
Yeah.
We still have to go?
What?
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
Yeah.
You want me to fuck off?
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Good.
No.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
Look, I'm busy.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
After five years.
Came by to check on you.
What do you want?
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
From your mouth.
What?
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I ain't a damn liar.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
And some things should never fucking happen!
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Lucky kid.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
We need to talk.
Still is, so let yourself out.
Your door was unlocked.
What are you doing here?
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
What's Mom think?
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
Why?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
So what are you gonna do?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Sorry.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
I just told you.
Tell me what?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
What?
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
What mess?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Okay...
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
You came out early.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
You know, people.
What people?
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You work too hard, Pop.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Didn't we already have this conversation?
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
That's right.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Why not?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
