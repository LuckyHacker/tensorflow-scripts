Oh, for Christ's sake!
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.

That's not what I meant.
Nice voice.
What d'you think of the singer?
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
Gave all that up.  Going into business.

Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
I don't understand.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Not now.  I don't have time.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Absolutely nothing.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Maybe even my destiny.
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
Oh, so that's it...
Yes, very.  And very married.
A peace officer... Impressive man
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Come and get him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
I asked where you got him.
Beauty, ain't he?
Where'd you get that horse?
Well I'm not so go home.
He said to turn loose of him.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
I want them spitting blood!
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Shut up, Ike.
Well now that's a little more Like it.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
No...
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
No...
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Well... 'bye.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
We're gonna get along just fine.
This brand.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Come on, you...
Good.  That's real good.
I'm retired.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
But wait, you don't understand-
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Excuse me?
Forget it.
Say when.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
I was kidding about that.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
Here it come: one-two-
On three?  You call it.
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
That's just my game.
In pace requiescat.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Age quod agis.
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Yeah, you look it.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
You retired, too?
That's the rumor.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Not exactly...
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Better.
How you feeling, Doc?
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
What's wrong, Doc?
Enough?  Never.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
You don't even know him.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Here, Doc.
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
All right.  Then what?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Then what do I do?
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
That's great coming from you.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
All right, Doc...
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
How you feelin', Doc?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Never got to wear one of those.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
Revenge?  For what?
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
So what does he want?
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
Doc...
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
No...
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Sorry, sorry...
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
But Doc-
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
In vino veritas.
He's drunk.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
Satisfied?
I'll remember you said that.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Ignore her?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
But who was the Devil?
Very instructive
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
Very cosmopolitan.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Since when is faro a business?
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
A which?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
What?
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
What?  But I saw 'em-
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
I don't.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Not half as bad as I feel.
You really look awful.
Sorry...
Don't touch me!
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Awful lot of money.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
Colorado's closer
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
I know.  Me neither.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
I made a promise.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
Good God, you're really-
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
No.
What?
No.
There's no reasoning with him.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
What was that all about?
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
Praise Jesus!
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Never even heard of anything like it.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
How is he?
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Wyatt!  My God...
Wait!
I have to go.
You did.  Well... thank you.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Wyatt...
No, no, get away, get away from me...
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I didn't mean it that way.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Getting late.  We better get back.
Always?
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I hate Sadie.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
And I don't even know your full name.
Fortuitous even.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
I know, me too.  What should we do About it?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
What's wrong?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
Room service.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Just doesn't, that's all.
How would you know?
Doesn't suit you.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Just answer.
Where do you get these questions?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
What about her?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
You're a little touchy about it.
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
I laugh sometimes
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
You'd die for fun?
Fun though, wasn't it?
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
That was lovely!
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Easy now... That mare's in season.
What is it?
I know what it means.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
What can I get you?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
'Least you admit it.
I need it.
Mattie.  What about this?
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Really?  You sure?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
All right, well, good night.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
No really, I can stay a while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Oh, all right.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
You get lonely?
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Come up to the fire, honey.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
'Least they don't scare women.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Forget it, Ringo.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
That what you got me up here for?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
You wanted to talk?
Well hello, Sherm.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.

Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.

Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
They're carrying guns in town.
You'll never make that stick.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.

You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.

Pretty fun too, isn't it?
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
