And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
I don't know.
But if they <u>do</u>?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Yes?
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
I'd sooner swim!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Unidentified Flying Objects.
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
My father!  He's not - ?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
What is it?
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You could train someone else.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
How is he - ?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Dave - !
Oh it does???
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Well?
We'll have to look for them later.
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Somewhere down there?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
The sound again?
You hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Listen!  Hear that?
Yeah?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
I think you're right.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
'Us?'
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
We're stuck tight!
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Cyclops?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
A lot of people think like that.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
So?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
I guess.
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
Huh?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
So they caught up with you, too?
Reef!
Helen.  I appeal to you -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
We hope!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
The frogmen?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Right at our one-eyed friend!
What course, Skipper?
What???
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Course and speed?
I...don't know!
What about down?
Seems to be all around...
Is there any way out of it?
Right, Skipper.
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
What????
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Why do you say that?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Something wrong?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Yes, Griff?
Excuse me, Skipper---
What about time...?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Anything ---
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Now they feel it...down below.
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Wonderful!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
All ready?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
There's got to be an explanation!
As we near the Pole...
What direction does the system indicate?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Under <u>water</u>?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Minus three.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Nothing we can do, now.
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
What?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
We can <u>ram</u> him!
But - what can we accomplish?
That's what I said!
Right <u>at</u> him?
Thirty-four seconds!
What's the running time?
Take a look.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
After torpedo room:  Report!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
What do you think?
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
Huh?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Who with?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
I met Dr. Kent, once.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Obviously.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Why?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
He did!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
Swell!
- for horrors like yourself?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
That's a <u>face</u>???
Come where?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
All right - go to it.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Toward the Pole!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
I'll be another!
Well, I'll be - !
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
See what?
Thank you.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
