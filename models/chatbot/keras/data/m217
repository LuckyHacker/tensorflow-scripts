Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
No, I just meant...
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
The thing's kind of heavy.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
I'll try to be more careful.
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
What?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
I guess.
No harm, no foul?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
So you admit it?
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Stop it!
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
I'm asking you to leave.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
You sent that?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Dom? What are you?
People get hurt that way.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Jesus Christ you're right.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Huh.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
I'm usually too tired to be.
Why's that?
No.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
You know, clean the pipes.
Hm?
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Mints?
Check.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Got cash.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
I don't know what to say.
Well? What are you waiting for?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
And this adversely affects me how...?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Shoot.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Yeah feels like it.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
I am?
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Uh-huh.
No You mean...?
Well think about it.
Huh? But why did Healy?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
What?
Mary's a babe!
Amen to that.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Never met him.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
What's so funny?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
Well... at least now you know.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Hey, look on the bright side --
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
His mother?
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
I don't know about this, Dom.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
You're kidding? What did they say?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Why not?
Yeah, right.
Well why don't you look her up?
I don't know.
I mean since then.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Mary again.
Well once. Mary.
Never?
Nah.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
It must be great with a wife like that.
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Loser? You?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
Good-looking?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
What's he like?
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
Yeah, but he was successful.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
He implied it.
Gay? He said you were gay?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Mary.
Who?
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Out getting coffee.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
So... I see you made the news.
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Who?
Who?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
We're in love with your roommate.
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
You got a brew?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
'That right?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Call you back.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Ahh.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Dumbshit.
Oh yeah.
Yep.
The sawbones?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
You found my car?!
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Am I?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
No I can't.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Healy, what I just tell you?
Here, just have one of these then.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Relax, he just ate.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Very nice.
Big time.
Stalker, huh?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Thanks.
Here's the info you asked for.
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Healy you dog!
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sure.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Are you okay?
Warren!
Urrggghh...
Forget it. It was... fun.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
All set.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
Turn it up, Magda.
Huh... that's strange.
Fuck!!
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Come on, what were you going to say?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
What?
Mary ah, forget it.
Well, I'll see ya.
I guess.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
So...
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Yeah.
-- Love story of our time.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
A fucking moron.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Have you seen it?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
You're a movie buff?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Lint?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
How about -- ?
That...? Vestibule.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Deco.
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
I know he's around here someplace.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
A surprise?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
Here you go.  What's that smell?
Fine. Fine.
Great.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
That sounds like fun.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
-- He's in a cage?!
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
No, I mean
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
I beg your pardon?
I work with retards.
What's that?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
Are you... an architect?
Some buildings I'm working on.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
It's right there on your golf bag.
How'd you know that?
I already know it, Mary.
Don't you want to know my name?
Pat Healy.
By the way, what's your name?
Same here again.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Thanks.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
You own a home there?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Nepal? Have you been?
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
No thanks.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Thanks.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
What?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
Your turn?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Do what?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Answer the question, shitball.
What do you mean 'why'?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Surprised?
Hey, hey, hey!
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Good good.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Jai alai?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Miami?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
What are you doing?
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Uh, that's okay.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
She's in a wheelchair?!
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Oh my.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Three different guys?
Four kids, three different guys.
Huh?
Nope. Never been.
So she's married?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
No, not at all.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
So she hasn't changed?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So you found Mary?
I think your life's about to change.
Really?  Very, very?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
You can't be serious.
You want her dead, don't you?
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
You don't buy what?
I don't buy it.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
Well, I know you're busy...
All you want is a phone number?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Uh-huh.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
Oh... Sully.
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
You were following us?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
What?
You little fuck.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Ho-ly shit.
I never said that.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Four.
How many is that?
Fucking sickening.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Why you son of a --
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Nice.
Friend. Baseball bat.
How'd you manage that one?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
And you met Mary how?
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
Bullshit!
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
What do you mean?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
You what?
Who?
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
You know, I really should take your card.
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
You mean him.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Kim and I are close friends!
Among others.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
You bet.
Harvard?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Same here.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
How do you guarantee that?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
I'd go with the seven.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
I see where you're going.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
'That right? Good for you.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Hm?
Oh. Well I am.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
That must make it tough.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Thanks for picking me up.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Ah, she's okay.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
No I'm not.
It means you're too hard on guys.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
I can live with those reflections.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Where's Puffy?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Magda!
Puffy, get over here.
Holy shit...
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
An old flame?
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Why?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Healy.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Bundt cake?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
I don't watch the new ones.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
What's a mook?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
What's he like?
He's no Steve Young.
Good lookin'?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
So who's the lucky guy?
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
Meaning?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Have you been up all night again?
Oh Jesus...
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
What...?
Mary, the man's a killer.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
I think you'd better sit down.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
What's up?
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Can I pour you one?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
You don't think they're too big?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
What's up, Doc?
Where would I have seen your work?
Pat does projects all over the world.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Pat's an architect, too.
Really.
Really?
Get over here.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
But but what about Steve?
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Ted...?
You forgot your keys!
What what are you doing here?
You're Woogie?
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Okay.
Go!
Mary, come on...
Please leave.
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Get out.
Toy poodle!
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Yeah, sure.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
All right, let's go.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Why not?
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Trying to be.
So you're a writer?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Well... why don't you move back?
We've got a lot in common.
Yeah?
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
I agree there should be more.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
Twenty-two.
What are you?
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
No short game.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Now by killer, you mean...?
Oh great, I ran out.
Sure.
On your ear, you've got something.
Hm?
What's that?
Thanks.
You look great.
Hi, Ted.
Hey.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Oh... are you... ?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
He's dead.
By the way, how's he doing?
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Really? I never got a message.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
And did everything -- ?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Who's that?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
You betcha!
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Just a minute.
Ted, are you okay?
Oh yeah.
Are you all right?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Hi, Mary.
Hi, Ted.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
The prom -- you going?
Huh?
So who you taking to the prom?
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh, are you on the team?
No, it's an old football injury.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Oh yeah. Fine.
No, that's really unneces --
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
One guess.
I think a little of both.
Is it the frank or the beans?
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
What?! No please, sir --
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Shhhhhh!
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
It.
You got what stuck?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
I wish.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Yeah? What do you want?
Teddy, be brave.
No, no, please!
I mean is it... is it...?
What do you mean?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
No! I was pissing!
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Is that bubble what I think it is?
I wasn't trying --
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Oh God.
Ho there.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
Uh-huh.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Eh.
So what's up?
Hey.
Bye, Ted.
See you, Warren.
Huh...?
See you, Warren.
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
How are you doing, Warren?
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Franks and beans!
Giddy-up.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Piggyback ride.
