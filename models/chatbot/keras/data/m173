No more violence... No more violence...
Bring her home... I guess.
No!  It wasn't like gore movies at all!  IT WAS REAL!
Is MOM... in there?
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
She wouldn't...
You don't think...
0h, shit!
Mother? 
Mrs. Sutphin?
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
What a bitch!
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
What happened?
Did you hear?
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Oh, boy! 
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hi, Mom.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
BLOOD FEAST!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
MURDERED?!!
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
You said you hated him.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Jeeezzz!
Hi!
He's really cute!
Here we go again.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
No comment!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
Carl's a jerk!
Is there a killer loose?
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
I certainly did not.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Always the dentist.
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Because it's the rules!
Why?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sorry, ma'am.
This is so silly. 
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
But, Chip...
In here, Mom...
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
You scared me.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
CHIP!!
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
I'm so happy I could shit.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Looks good, Mom!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
Oh Mom...
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
But Mom, the video's not over.
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Let me see!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Thanks, Mom.
Chip, honey?
She sure can pick 'em!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
You mean for TV or print?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
That's right.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Your mom killed my brother!
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Bird books mostly...
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Detectives, what is this about?
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Hi, Hank.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
He goes to college with me!
Oh, honey!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Ooohhhh!
Don't wake the kids...
Oooohhhh.
Shhhh..
Oohhhh, Eugene!
You bring me such peace...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
I love that you're my wife.
We can be real quiet...
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Don't I get a kiss?
Goodnight, honey.
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Chip, your ride is here.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
No woman would!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
That's nice.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
...People who don't mind their own business.
"P" as in...
Yes, I did.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
What a mess.
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
I know Dottie!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Objection! Argumentative!
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
I certainly did.
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
So you admit you just lied?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you do drink?
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
I certainly was not!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
No, I don't.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
I didn't do it!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
What did you just say?
Are those pussy-willows?
It's not fair!!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
COCKSUCKER! 
MOTHERFUCKER!!
GODDAMN YOU!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Who is this?
I beg your pardon?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
FUCK YOU! 
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
You bitch!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Hello.
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Yes, I was.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Marvin A. Pickles.
State your name, please.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
You got your wish.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
It's him!
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
We all have bad nights. 
He killed people, Mom.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
And who may I ask is Carl?
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
It's sugarless.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
I do, please.
Who wants fruit salad?
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Yes... but... I didn't...
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Yes, but I lent it...
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
...Browsing.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
That's like your car, Beverly,
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Beverly, are you alright?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Certainly not!
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
There is one big problem though.
He's a good boy.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Bon Appetit!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Right here!
Mrs... Sutphin?
Now, here's a babe!
Murder, honey.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Yes you are.
Are we leaving?
You forgot something...
Man, that one made me puke!
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
What is it, Betty?
How to send a bill!!
What's he know?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What was that?
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
I'll take this instead.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
