There's nothing stopping you.
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
That's none of their affair.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
No thanks.
You're welcome to one.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
I don't make policy.
Got any more ideas?
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
You want 'em all arrested?
You haven't tried locking them up!
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Well?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
How's it going?
Mornin'.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
The woman question?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Yeah.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
It never ends.
How goes it?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
Take a drink. Calm down!
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
An American.
Who? A scab?
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
So much the better.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Yes. We will light the candles.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
They are singing for me.
Why are they singing, Mama?
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
No, Estellita.
Are you sick, Mama?
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
To the mine?
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
What are you saying?
This is what we've been waiting for.
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Will you be still?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Like what?
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Ramón -- you can't.
No.
Alone?
Sun up.
When?
Hunting.
Where are you going?
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Tell me.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Be still ...
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
You weren't waiting for me.
I waited up till midnight.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
A meeting?
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
How do you feel?
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
I've had them since the day they were born.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I'm going back tomorrow.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Yes.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
Sure.
You all right?
Backward.
Can be what?
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
No.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Over my dead body.
Let them take it!
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
What makes you so sure?
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
They say I am no good to you.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
He'll have it good. Some day.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
A fighter, huh?
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
What's the matter?
I did forget. Luís told me.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Antonio paid for it.
Was it expensive, the beer?
No, no ...
I'm a fool.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Aaah, what's the use?
Never... never... never!
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
What has it got me, your union?
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
What's more important than sanitation?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
What?
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Forget it.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
This water's cold again.
Got to talk to the brothers.
Where you going?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
But honey ...
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
You know I don't think that.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Go on. Spill it.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Well, if that's possible ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
No ...
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No. New York.
You mean Delaware?
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
You should have helped her without being asked.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
You've got to help around the house!
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
The what!
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Where's your mama?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Luís! Come down here!
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Forgot what?
I thought maybe you forgot...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
My kids don't have enough to eat!
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What attitude?
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
