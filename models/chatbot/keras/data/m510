You don't remember?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
How did you get me out of there?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
What?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
What are you talking about-
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
Martin, what-
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
Hi, darling.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Maybe an animal.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
She was old.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
What?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Who's that?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
What? What am I supposed to sense?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
In the village.  Look what I found.
Where have you been?
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Where have you been all day?
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
So, did you sleep good?
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Martin, it's not funny!
Someone from the village.
Who was that?
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
So do I, believe me.
I miss Tommi so much.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
What?
Cherry-red Tears.
We just have to make a new beginning.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I just had a really strange experience.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Making our very own solstice fire.
What are you doing?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Where are you going?
Yes, daddy.
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
You?
I'll do it myself.
Do you have a better idea?
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Oh, damnit!
Hey... the fuse.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
I mean the armchair!
It still worked in town.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
You'll never get away from me!
Stop that!
Oh God, Tommi...
Ellen, move aside...
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
I have to cut his windpipe...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Come on, say it.  You know...
Why else?
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
But what is the truth?
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Thank you.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Ellen.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
1976.  What happened back then?
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Do I look like it that much?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Ellen Straub.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
No, I've never seen him before.
Does this dog here belong to you?
Hello.  Can I help you?
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
What?
I've killed my husband!
Mrs. Straub!
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
And that is?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Hammer?
Yes, something was...
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
We should leave the past alone.
You didn't tell her!
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Twenty-three, to be exact.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Very funny.
Tenth floor.
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Well, look here!
