Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Where these tracks headed?
I know.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Maybe dinner.
Let's load 'em.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Just listen.
What do you want from us?
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Sixteen.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Yeah.
That night?
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
You can't let anybody leave!
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Anybody sick?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
So what's our problem?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Maybe.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
You promise?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Now why'd you go and...
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
What you doin'?
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
Finish what?
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
We'll see...
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Have you come across Fuchs?
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
What?
Watch Clark.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
I don't know who to trust.
How you doin', old boy?
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Too damn dangerous.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Let's open it.  Now...
Hell no.
Let's open it.
If it did get to him.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Now hold on, you dumb...
We got to burn 'em.
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Let go of me...
Childs!!
Now who'd go and do...
Somebody broke in.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Don't walk behind me.
What?
Ain't it there?
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Cool it, Palmer!!
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
You lying bastard...
Was dark... find a light...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
You catch anything he was saying?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Cut him loose?
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Clark, you come on out here!!
It's shorted out or something!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
Childs!  That a fuse?
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Then we'll never make it.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Neither will we.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Not the only one.
What do you mean "you think so?"
I think so.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Spaceship of some kind.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Load of bullshit.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
We should have jumped his ass.
Then kill me.
Then I'll have to kill you.
You ain't tying me up.
For your health.
What for?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
We ain't buying that.
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
You been made, MacReady.
What clothes?
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
What are you doing?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Gee, thanks!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Garry's missing!
What?
MacReady!
We got morphine, don't we.
What do we do about those three?
He's gone already!  Do it!
But...
Torch them!!
How the fuck do I know?!
What we going to do?!
Probably the next meal.
Where's the other half?
That's good enough.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
You buy any of this, Blair?
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Well, go on.
Look, I'm just guessing...
MacReady!
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
The dogs?
Torch it over there!
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
What's happening?
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
Thank you.
I guess you're okay.
Damn you, MacReady!
And if anyone tries to wake me...
Enough, MacReady!
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Now hold him.
I think so.
Would that test have worked?
I guess I'm the only one.
Well, who's got access to it?
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
What are you doing?
All in Norwegian.
Anything?
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Hey, Sweden!!!
Come on, Copper.
My God, what in hell happened here?
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Well, get to it.
A couple of hours.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Bennings?
In this weather?
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Nothing we can do about that.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
After all this mess.
After all this mess then.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
A day or so ago... I guess.
When was the last time you used it?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
A serum test possibly.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
What's that?
Right.  Why not?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
How many in their party?
That far?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How far's that?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
I'll put this right through your head.
No.
Put that down!
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Well, stick to it.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
You reach anybody yet?
Hey, man...!
Little over two hours.
How long's it been?
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Looks good.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Damn if I won't.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
I am going after them.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Extinguishers.
Don't let up, Childs!
We're on fire!
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
He's dead.
Tie up Clark, too.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
What kind of test?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
We going to make it?
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Move it, Palmer.
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
And that was enough?
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
What's...
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Four!
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
He might just wait us out.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
What if it doesn't come?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
Why?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
Where were the flashlights?
Can you think of any other tests?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
Bet the last place you ever go.
Then we go after him.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Position, my ass...
Calm down and get in your position.
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Screw the generator!!
The generator!
Get back!!
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
What about Childs?
Anyplace but here.
Where was he trying to go?
Everything that's been missing.
What is it?
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
This storm do that?
Just keep looking.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
Well, let's get down there.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
Yeah!
MacReady, that you?
What's happened?!
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
We should sleep in shifts.
Who else could have used that key?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
So what do you make of it?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
What for?
Get your gear on.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
You jerking off or just pissed?
Can't hear you.
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
What?!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
Hear what?
You hear that?
When do you think it got to him?
He's one of them.
MacReady...?
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
