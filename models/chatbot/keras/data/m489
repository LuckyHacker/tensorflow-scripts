We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
All right. Stand by.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
But I have no sister.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Yoda spoke of another.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
I can't kill my own father.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
But I had to help my friends.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I can't do it, Ben.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
There's still good in him.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
Yoda will always be with you.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Who are you?
Jabba's palace.
Where am I?
Your eyesight will return in time.
I can't see.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
His lightsaber.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
They are clear, my Master.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
I have felt him, my Master.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Yes, my Master.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
As you wish.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Yes, my Master.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Hey!
Yeah, sure.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
We got separated.
I thought she was with you.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Vader's on that ship.
All set.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Yeah, she's comin' up.
You got her warmed?
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Luke.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Oh... great!
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
The same as always.
How are we doing?
Wouldn't miss it.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Are you all right?
Luke!
Han!
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Yes.
You love him, don't you?
He wasn't. I can feel it.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Here's the terminal.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Hold me.
I'm sorry.
Ahhh...
I...
I don't know.
What's going on?
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Shall we try and go around?
It'll work. It'll work.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Hey, are you awake?
That's all any of us can see.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
I gotta get you out of here.
Leia!
Someone who loves you.
You, too.
Good luck.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
I'm trying!
Lower it!
Lando, grab it!
Lando!
Han! Chewie?
Let's see.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Come on! Come on!
We're coming!
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
What did he say?
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Proper?!
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
What are you telling them?
All right, hang on.
Here we go again.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
Good, I hate long waits.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
We shall double our efforts.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
There it is!
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Here goes nothing.
I'm going in.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Good shot, Red Two.
Red Leader standing by.
All wings report in.
Oh, no.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Quiet.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
What's he saying?
Your Royal Highness.
Oh!
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Ugh!
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
But, why must you confront him?
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
Then you know why I have to face him.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Yes. It's you Leia.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
Your father?
He's my father.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Tell me.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
What do you remember?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Over there! Two more of them!
Never-r-r!
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
I will not fight you.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
There is no conflict.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
I will not fight you, father.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
If that is your destiny.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
Come with me.
So, you have accepted the truth.
I know, father.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Well, I'm sorry.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Yes.
Told you, did he?
Your father he is.
Yoda, I must know.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Disintegrated?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
How many languages do you speak?
Oh. Well, yes.
Yes or no will do.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
