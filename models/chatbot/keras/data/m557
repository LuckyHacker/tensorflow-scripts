Give a kiss to Edward.
...give a kiss to Edward.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
I know.
I don't need them anymore...
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
What's wrong?
Damn him.
Baked in a pie.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
...a pocketful of rye.
What happened?
Is it cold in here?
No.  No.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
She said convincingly.
I'll be fine.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
He needs to be turned over.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Why did we stop?
Nothing.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Sing a song of sixpence.
That's my girl.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Okay.
Don't bring it home in this.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Yes mother.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
No.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Okay, okay...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
I'd be there for him.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I do it all the time!
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Shush.
Miriam...
I don't want to find out.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
She adores you.
Lucien Baines?
He hates me.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Did we go sailing?
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
A pocketful of rye...
Sing a song of sixpence...
No.  Thank you.
No problem.
Thank you.
I got it.
They're hungry.
I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
It doesn't matter...
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
He's mine?
So you say.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Well look at that.
Good for them.
Yep.  Eloped.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
You sure about this?
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
That went well.
I can't leave him!
COME ON!
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Where the hell are we?
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Little boy?!  That's him!
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Like hell "wait."
Wait...
Okay, okay...
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Yes.  I am.
You're sure of that?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
Tell me.
What difference does it make...?
What happened?
What happened to Charles Gish?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
If you believe that.
Evil.
Then what is he?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
You think you can do this, don't you?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
What about Julia?
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
I did, yeah.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Why'd you bring him here?
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
What did you see?
With Stargher I saw things...
That's what therapists are for, right?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Peter, okay?
Agent Novak?
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
What then?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
Do you think that's funny?
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
I know him.
You don't know the procedure.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
How hard could it be...?
I realize that...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
There's always a chance they'll confess.
As far as I needed.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
I bet we can fix it.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Oh no... No you don't.
Mocky-Lock.
Who says?
's broken.
What now?
He's beautiful...
You liked him?
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
You're kidding me.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Delano?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
That hoist, with the winch...
Already there.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Agent Cole.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Instead of going into his mind...
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
What's wrong?
She changed the codes.
I think that's the whole point.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Initiating connection.
Intravenous administration complete.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Completely unaware.
What about the cat?
Awaiting his arrival.
How's the patient.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
That's a secret.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
You're looking well.
Dr. Kent.
Agent Novak.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Is she alright?
I doubt that.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
Any psychiatric medication?
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Absolutely.
Nervous?
No.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Yes.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I'll get her...
Catherine!
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
What about the legalities of this...?
Sometime yesterday morning.
When did he lapse into the coma?
It's his dog.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
Now.
Now?
I need it.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
So?
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Someone looking after her little girl?
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Considering where I've been...
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
Next time, tell me, okay?
Right here.
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
I don't have to.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
What else do we do?!
You sure you want to go through with this?
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
No.  Can you get a man close?
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
We proceed assuming she is.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Here he is.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
How is she?
