You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
I'm... discouraged.
You're discouraged.
Most don't.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Nineteen zero and nine.
When did he die?
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
Yes I do.
You don't know what he thinks.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
How come're you doin that?
Yes, you've circled round.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
In Angola. Yeah.
That man that shot you died in prison.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
How fresh is this coffee?
'Predate it.
Want a cup?
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
Didn't know there was any.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
I am older.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
How you been, Ellis?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How many a those things you got now?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
How's that?
You heard it?
Who else'd be in your truck.
How'd you know I was here.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Hard to believe.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Oh yes.
He's real all right.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Well what would you call him.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Uh-huh.
None of that explains your man though.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
Try "old" on for size.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
Yes.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
No money in his room there?
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
No ID in her room?
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No.
Carla Jean...
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Yes ma'am, I do.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yes ma'am?
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
He can take all comers.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
He won't neither. He never has.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Some pretty bad people.
Who's he in trouble with then?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Would you tell me if you had?
Not word one.
Nothin'?
No I ain't.
You ain't heard from him?
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Yessir.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
How's that, Sheriff?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
You gonna drive out there?
Okay.
Yessir. It was punched out.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
No sir.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Well I don't either!
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yes sir.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
No sir.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Wasn't no bullet?
Wasn't no bullet.
What was the bullet?
I don't know. He ought to...
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
I'm ahead of you there.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Sheriff?
...Now that's aggravating.
I don't know. Oh.
So when was he here?
Probably must be.
That from the lock?
Believe you're right.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
I'm hidin' behind you.
What about yours?
Gun out and up.
We goin' in?
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
No. Probably I don't.
But you don't believe it.
That's possible.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
I don't know...
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
Mm.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
You figure him for a dope runner?
That's the boy.
Llewelyn Moss?
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.
You sure?
...You ride Winston.
Uh-huh.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
The old boy shot by the highway?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
It could be.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
Yes Sheriff.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
...This month's checks.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I don't know. Had dreams.
...How'd you sleep?
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I mean, would you care to join me.
I can't plan your day.
What do you think.
Okay.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Well. If you say so.
Don't hurt no one.
I never do.
Don't get hurt.
I always am.
...Be careful.
That's very nice.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Hyah!
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I thought it was a car afire.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
Well I didn't see it.
I put it in, Mama.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I got it Mama.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
It ain't even three years we been married.
Yes. Things fall into place.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
To your husband.
You gave your word?
No. But I gave my word.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
...I need to sit down.
I wouldn't worry about it.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
No.
I ain't got the money.
No.
She'll be all right?
She'll be all right.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
I can hear it in your voice.
What makes you say that?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What did you tell him?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
You know what's goin' on?
What should I do?
Hey.
Llewelyn?
I shall return.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Yes ma'am?
Llewelyn?
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
You should be used to that.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Uh-huh.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Yes I do.
Promise?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
You can't afford one?
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Llewelyn --
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
So... for how long do we have to...
Well -- how come?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Odessa.
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
What're you goin' to do?
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Goin' where?
Goin' out.
What're you doin', baby?
Yeah.
Llewelyn.
That'll work.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Just keep it up.
Big talk.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
I need to know that.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
What'd you give for that thing?
What? Quit hollerin'.
Llewelyn!
No. I found it.
Did you buy that gun?
At the gettin' place.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
That'll be the day.
It's full a money.
What's in the satchel?
I mean the nature of you.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You go to hell.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
And where is that.
I know where it's going to be.
What's that.
I know something better.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know where the money is.
Why would I let you do that?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
You expect him?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Is Llewelyn there?
Hello?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Where does he work?
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Yes I did.
Did you go up to his trailer?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Yessir?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
I don't know.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Airport.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
What airport would you use.
You from around here?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
No me mate.
How'd you find it?
All right...
Not a bleep.
...You getting anything on this?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
...Where's the transponder?
Screwgie.
Mm-hm.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Huh? What is...
Step out of the car please, sir.
What's this about?
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
No. Do you?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
So what're you goin' up there for.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
You know she won't be there.
All right.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
...I know where you are.
Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
I don't need to talk to you.
...You need to talk to me.
You know who it is.
Who is this.
I see.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Nobody. Accounting.
Yes.
...Me?
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
...Where you want me to put it?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Sir?
...Don't put it in your pocket.
All right. Heads then.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
How's that?
Everything.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
No.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
I didn't put nothin' up.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Just call it.
For what?
Yes.
Call it?
Call it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Sir?
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
You married into it.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
You married into it.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
You've lived here all your life?
Yes I do.
You live in that house behind the store?
Well... I need to close now --
You said that.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
I could come back then.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Well...
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Sir?
...What time do you go to bed.
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
Sir?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Generally around dark. At dark.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Now. We close now.
What time do you close?
Yessir.
See about closing.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You already asked me that.
Will there be anything else?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
With anything?
With what?
Is somethin' wrong?
I don't know. Will there?
...Will there be somethin' else?
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
I was just passin' the time.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
I seen you was from Dallas.
What way would that be?
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
This. And the gas.
Sixty-nine cent.
How much?
No sir, it's unusual.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Okay.
Good. I need everything else.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
You on all night?
That's twenty-six dollars.
One room, one night.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
The kind with the most poles.
What kind of tent?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Somethin' like that.
You already have the tent?
Uh-huh.
Tent poles.
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Let's just call it square.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
It's all right.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
What room?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
I'm sorry.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
Yes?
...I'm wondering...
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
Okay. We can stop that.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
What do you want to know?
That's not an answer.
Well enough.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Okay.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Yessir.
Yessir. I understand that.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
November the 28th, last year.
When did you last see him.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
I do like you.
Then you'll like me.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
What else then?
Half.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Waitin' for my wife.
I got beers in my room.
That's me.
That's got two double beds.
No, one forty-two.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
What about one forty-two.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
Another additional.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
You want to change rooms?
Could I get another room.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
The option.
The what?
You tell me the option.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
No. You don't.
No I don't have it.
The heroin. You don't have it.
What product.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
To kill your wife.
Why would he go to Odessa?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
So was I.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Were you in Nam?
What did I say?
Pot metal?
I didn't say braze.
I don't mean braze.
Yes.
Cast iron?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I'm a welder.
What did you do?
I'm retired.
...What do you do?
No. You don't understand.
I been immobile.
Took me about three hours.
Not any way.
Not that way.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
It's called a transponder.
I know how he found me.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Sugar?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
How would you describe him?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
...But that won't last.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
What outfit.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Nam?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Are you in the service?
Yes sir.
Don't jack with me.
No sir.
Are you jackin' with me?
I got an overcoat on.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
No sir.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
I don't know.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
You do, I reckon.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
I don't know. American citizens.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
