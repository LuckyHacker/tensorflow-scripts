C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Yes...
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
I tried...
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Cuervo...?
Go on now. Do as I say.
Ooww!
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Who's that?
Cuervo, look out behind you!
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
He's... near.
Where's Plissken?
It's so good to see you again.
What?
Oh Cuervo...
Where?
I thought he was, but he came back.
You told me he was dead.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
Give it.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Give it to me.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Where is he?
We'll see.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Shit.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Can you land?
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
Somebody get off!
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
See you in hell, Snake.
I don't know yet.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
Say goodnight, Carjack.
Dream on, blue eye.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
I see your point. What's the favor?
I'm already dead.
I got a new deal for you.
All right, so I made another deal.
Don't lie to me.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Not anymore.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
What's in it for me?
I need a favor.
The name's Plissken.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Got a smoke?
Yeah, I got it.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
It's history. I gotta go.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
I'm here.
Plissken...?
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
75% power.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Locked.
Lock fuel rods.
She's in the green.
Good.
No.
Not you?
A medical team will be standing by.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Where do I put ashore?
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
So what does this thing do?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Defense against what?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Call me Snake.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Get this crap out of me.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Having second thoughts?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
That's the deal.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
What's the little black box do?
Shut up, Plissken.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Does he know how to activate it?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
So where's Plissken?
Getting ready to invade.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Is that what I think it is?
If he lets you get close enough.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Yeah, kinda.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Don't like it, don't come.
I don't know about this thing.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Aw, come on, Snake.
We'll see.
Me too?
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
How do you know all this?
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Later.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Not yet.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Where are they going?
Right over there.
Where is it?
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I said pull over.
No way.
Stop the damn car.
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
Delgado?
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Location.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Where are they?
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
Where'd they go?
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Which way?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Looking to get out.
What're you doing in here?
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
Who?
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
Where?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Down that way.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Who?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Find Cuervo Jones.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
The freeway.
What the hell is this?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
Snake - what is it?
Sewers. Come on.
How do we get out of here?
The what?
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Like hell I do.
You need help.
Don't follow me.
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Who?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
No screamin' shit.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
What are they?
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
Are you crazy?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Give me the prototype.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Thank God.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
You're running out of time.
Well, I'll think it over.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yeah.
All of us?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Who ain't?
I'm looking for somebody.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
