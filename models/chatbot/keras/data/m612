Please.
What?!
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
I would like to use the bathroom --
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Why?  What's the problem?
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
What about our end?
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Washington?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
No idea who's behind this?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Had a lot of blood in him.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
We don't know that.
God isn't there to do it.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
A whore fucking.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Wrong answers?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Don't call me that.
Walter --
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
What's your theory?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
The bearer of bad news.
Hello, Adrian.
Hi, Jon.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Jon --
Veidt¹s complex.
Jon, where are we?
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
Jon -- what??
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Cured, yes.
What -- am I --
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I won't do that.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You're the only human being I care for.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Because --
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
Jon, no -- I can't --
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Collect me?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
I could stay and go.
Mm hmm.
Would you like me to stay?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
I'm here, Laurie.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Blake?  Dead?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
What if you¹re wrong??
I¹m not.
And what if you¹re wrong?
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Adrian -- you've lost it.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
What is it?  How does it work?
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
What??
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
The missing scientists.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
She's with me.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Who?
Good night.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
No.  I just wanted you to --
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Dan -- what do we do now?
Everything's changed --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Where did he go?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
What was he doing?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
I think he's going to the john.
What's he doing?
. . . What??
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
That's because --
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Yes you are.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
The costumes.  Am I right?
What?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
They're practically on us . . .
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
All right.  Mission accomplished.
They're following us.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
What the hell -- ?
Okay!
This'd better not be what I think it is.
Don't look.  Turn around.
What are you up to?
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
You and me.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Antarctica??
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Memory lane.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Laurie --
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
-- What is it.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
. . . What?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Old?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Play one.  Educate yourself.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
His . . . whatever.
His what?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
You're sure?
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
Maybe not, but why take chances?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Damn straight.

Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
What caused it?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What happened?
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Coward.  Giving up.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Where's Laurie?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
What do you mean, frame-up?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What new information?
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
. . . That was quick.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
So do I.  So do you.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
-- What?
I can fix it.
Janey, will you marry me?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back --  What?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
With lots of ketchup?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Isn't it true that you --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Did you know he was back on the streets?
No comment.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Am I free to go?
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
What does this mean?  What does it --
I'm terribly sorry.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I don't know their real names!
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names.
Their real names, please.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Maybe I'll do that.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
What about you?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Please.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Adrian.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
You're making a big --
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
What is that ungodly smell?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Ever see one of these before?
New information.
