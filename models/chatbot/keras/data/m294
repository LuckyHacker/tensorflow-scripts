Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
You do?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Why?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Yeah?
Ok!
I get the imports.
One more time.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
Not my imports.
I get all your CDs.
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
I think it's funny.
As fucking if.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
I never fucked Rod.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
Calm down Brent.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
That's impossible.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
is there anything you do?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
So?
She's my daughter, Tom.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
Hi Jody.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Good.
No.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
Run!
No!
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
What did you hear?
No I wasn't.
You were eavesdropping.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Who is she Daddy?
It can't be.
You know her?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
Are you sure?
It was a she.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I'm not.
You are upset.
No honey.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Ok.
You never went, uh, all the way?
Not much further.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
How much further?
A little.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
What do you mean?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
What's wrong?
Hi honey.
I will. Is that all?
I want you to head right home after school.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
Hi honey.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
You said that two weeks ago.
It won't happen again.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
You're grounded Friday night!
Daddy you scared me!
It's almost ten o'clock.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Are you sure?
Should we close down any eruption?
No?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
No. I'll handle this.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
You found her?
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
She's underage.
This will relax her.
What are you doing?
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
Did you warn her?
She's still a virgin.
Well?
She just turned off her light.
Is Jody still awake?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
What happened?
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Why?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Really?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
No, you couldn't.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
No.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
I can.
Can you get inside?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
She was murdered?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Of what?
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
She works at a church?
St. Michael's.
You know where I can find her?
She's not here.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
Hello?
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
You're not?
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Daddy....
Your brother told us.

I know where you're going.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Ok.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Who's?
We just found another body.
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
I'm sure you should have failed.
You gave me a 'D'.
What?
You fucked me up!
What are you doing here?
Pay no attention to me.
You think you're my sister?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
You're the killed.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Yes.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
_ Your father raped someone?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
What do you know about my father?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Me? Why me?
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
Really?
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
I really do. For your own safety.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Then you should go.
Of course I'm scared.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
You know about that too?
You aren't going to the party?
Sure.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
I am.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
I can't right now.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Stag?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
I won't.
Especially not your dad.
Ok.
You can't tell your parents.
No.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
What party?
Mark invited me to the party.
What?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
FINE. Are you?
You ok?
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
Someone tried to kill me.
NO?!
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Not that many.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
OK. increase the peace.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
No!
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
He says he loves me.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Oh nice save.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
Does she fuck?
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
No! That's his table.
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You eventually have to talk to him.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
Why?
Mark Shale.
Who?
Go sit next to him.
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
No.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
You Miss Dunlop?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Don't you think it's sick?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
You heard about that?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
This place is empty.
Follow me.
Twenty eight years ago.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
Pretend we're just another couple.
What are you doing?
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
I love you.
Thanks for coming back for me.
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Go to the police station!
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
My dad's down there!
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
What?
Jody. Wait.
This party is sick.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Sharon's far from a slut.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
That's not why we broke up.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Yeah.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Are you coming to the party?
I don't know. I kind of am.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
Yes!
I'll think about it.
They're not picking me up until six.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I do not.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
You know I want to go with you.
Did Sharon say no?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Why?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
I did.
I heard you got attacked.
I'm fine.
Are you O.K.?
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
What?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
I got to get home.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Why?
Cut it out.
NO!
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Who was the fourth?
Yes.
The principal?
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
You're not telling me something.
Two men left town right after it happened.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Who?
Who were they?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
The word is Mob.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
How could you?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
And the police did nothing?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Why not?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
You didn't believe her?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
Attacked how?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
What?
Wait.
Don't make me order you.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Who is she?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
The library. I'll be fine.
Where are you going?
Not that I know of.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Did he say anything else about her?
That's what he said.
What?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Yeah. Who is she?
Lisa Sherman?
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
You can ask me anything.
I need to ask you something.
Yes?
Mom?
Hi princess.
Hi mom.
His mother's an only child.
His mother's side.
On what side of the family?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
Kenny's aunt?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Yeah.
Are you Jody?
Yes?
I'm worried about someone.
What?
I got to go.
What are you doing?
I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
What?
Just thinking about something.
You ok?
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
Now don't be nervous.
So are you.
You're so beautiful.
No, you keep one.
You can have both if you want.
They're tasty.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Did you want one?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Hi Sandy.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
And she didn't?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Told you to hide it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I'm not leaving it here.
You can't bring it.
No.
Hide your laptop here.
Ok.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
ROD!
Stacy?
Yes. Unfair to me.
Unfair?!
You're being unfair.
Rod!
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
That wasn't me ...
If sheep don't count.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
What?
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Maybe it won't stay in.
But you don't really mean it.
I said no.
