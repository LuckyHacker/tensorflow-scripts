Go fuck yourself.
What?
Darryl.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
See ya.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
You want anything special for dinner?
What?!
Hon?
Uh-huh.
Have a good day at work today.
What.
Hon.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
In the leg.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
On what?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Why?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
What?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Yes, baby?
Honey?
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
Aw, God.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Who's the nut?
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Who do you think did it?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
You want to come on in?
No!
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
How are things goin' out there?
Hey.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
We're both fine.
Yes, sir.  I know.
You girls are in some hot water.
I've been better.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
I have no problem with that.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
That's certainly possible.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Alright.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Oh, great.
Armed robber.
It's him.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
Tell us about him.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Oh, definitely.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
My Lord.
Good God.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Right.  Where are they?
A .38.
What kind of gun was it?
Shut up.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Louise is alright.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
I'm spinning.
What for?
Stop.
What's wrong?
Oh shit.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
You're a little angle, you are.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Tell me.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
How?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
What?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
You're a bank robber?
I'm a robber.
What did ya do?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I am the great and powerful Oz...
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
Well, you wanna use the shower?
That sounds nice.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Thelma?  It's me.
Louise, is that you?
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Did you get married real young?
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
A regular outlaw.
I always knew that.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Who's your friend?
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
I'm choking on it.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
Why now, Jimmy?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Will you at least see how it fits?
Maybe.
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
It's nothin' like that.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Maybe.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
It's me.
Who is it?
Hello...
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Hey, peaches.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
What?
Peaches.
And what's the mysterious code word?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Who did it?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Okay.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Call me back.
Tell me now.
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
Can't it go to any office?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Not yet.
You're in Oklahoma?!
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Christ, sure... yes!
Do you love me?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
What the fuck is going on?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Where'd y'all go?
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
Am I in trouble?
Front.
In the back?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Yes.
Is this your car?
Oh yeah.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
You're a good friend.
Go?
Go.
What are you talkin' about?
Then let's not get caught.
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Now what?
All this for us?
God!  It looks like the Army!
It's grand!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
What in the hell is it?!
Way up ahead!
Where?!
What in the hell is that up there?
What?!
Louise!
How do you stay so positive?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
You too, sweetie, the best.
You're a good friend.
You're crazy.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
Why?
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Oh.
What?!  What d'you think?!
What?!
Shit!
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Shit!
How long do you think that'll take?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How far are we from Mexico?
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Yup.
We've gone insane.
What?
You know what's happened, don't you?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Does that mean suck my dick?
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
Pass him!
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
You're drivin'.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
We can live in a hacienda.
We can change our names.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
Good.
Me too.  I feel awake.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
You awake?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
No.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Eeuww.
He said they're charging us with murder.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Thelma, that is not an option.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
What do you mean?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Yes, Thelma?
Louise?
Whatever.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
I said all that?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
What?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What'd I say again?
You know why.  You already said.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
Are you alright?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Yeah.
Yeah, you want it?
You do?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
Just asking.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Yes.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
I believe you.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Hit it.
Ready?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Shoot the radio!
What?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
I am really sorry about this.
About how fast was I going?
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Thelma!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
What?!  What about him?!
Harlan.
What?!
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?
We should have just ignored him.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Just ignore him.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Well, you got it now.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Gosh.  It sure is.
This is so beautiful.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
I can see that.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Like a Chihuahua?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
What little dogs?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Before.
You mean now or before?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Yeah.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Whaddo we do?
Now what what?
Now what?
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Idaho?
Just past Boise City.
Louise?  Where are we?
You're right.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
I... I...
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
What.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Let's get it over with.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Alright, Louise!
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Why not?!
It won't work.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
What for?
I want you to call Darryl.
Yeah.
Thelma.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Litterbug.
Try to.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Yes!  I believe I am!
You're disturbed.
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
You think you've found your calling?
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Lemme see the map.
Holy shit.
Well, I just...
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
What happened?
Drive!  Drive away!
No.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Taking a shower.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
What happened to your hair?
Have another drink, Thelma.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
How do I look?
I won't wait up.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I heard that.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
Thelma kinda took to him.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
She thinks he's a pig.
That's puttin' it mildly.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
What did Darryl say?
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Louise.
It's probably not a good idea.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I don't know.  I won't be.
Will I be?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Call him?
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
But you think he fools around.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I think better when I drive.
Did you finish thinking?
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
You're not touchin' that car.
Give me the keys.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
Why are you actin' like this?
What do you mean?
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
I'm cash poor.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
So this is all my fault, is it.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
Yes.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Which part?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Louise.  Where are we going?
West.  Left.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Get the car!
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Get the car.
Oh my God.
Ready when you are.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Exactly.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
Maybe.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Yeah!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Thelma!
Isn't this fun?
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How come he let you go?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Whose place is this again?
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
In case of what?
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Okay.  I will, too.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I'll call you right back.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Fuck you.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Fuck that.
Say you're sorry.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
You got that right.
You women are crazy!
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
We been seein' you all along the way.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
Yeah... sure did.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Oh, Jesus!
Fresno.
Where you goin'?
Grrrreat!
We're fine!  How are you?
Hi there!  You alright?
Hi!
