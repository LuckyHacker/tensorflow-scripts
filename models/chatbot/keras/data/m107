Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
I don't have all day, kid.
Alright, asshole.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Oh, come on!
Yes it does.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
He's not part of the program.
Pause play.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Speaking of which, duck!
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
You got lucky.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
Punk?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Done?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
We made it?
Minimal.
I don't know. Nothing.
What?
His mother?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Can we blow it with just two?
We don't have a choice!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
What's that?
No.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
What are you doing?!!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
It's locked!
Could you show a little compassion?!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Goodbye old friend.
We don't have time to argue!
We're not leaving Crutch!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Duck fuckers?
Get out of here!
Sergeant!
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Rizzo did.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Bomb?
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
He came for me, I had to run!
Where the hell were you?!!
He....He...
Where have you been?!!
Thorgan, pull us in.
Okay that hurt.
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
What?!
Uh-oh.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
Thorgan, suit up.
Goodbye, my love.
Let's move out!
Done!
Two more charges to go.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
What are you doing back?!!
Kay-Em!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Hey! I'm not ready.
They're back here.
I'll need system four converters.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
We're not supposed to do that.
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
The hull's imploding!
Shit!
I think I broke my arm.
Everyone okay?
Where'd you get the gun?
Better let me.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
You see that?
And you said high school was boring.
Nice touch.
Cool.
Creepy.
Hey, easy now.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Suit up.
Earth II.
And now we're all out of it.
It bought us some time.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Hurry!
I don't know!
Then what do we do?!
Then stop talking and work faster!
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Where is...?
Thorgan? You coming?!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
How many?
We could convert fission transistors.
We'd need charges.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
What?
Sergeant!
But I didn't see...
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Yeah yeah. Got it.
You just keep an eye out.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
You got that right.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Not a chance.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Yllo, what's your head count?
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Wait a minute...I need...
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
My job.
What the hell are you doing?
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
You're a teacher.
I am an expert!
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
Get them in the lab!
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
We need weapons.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Where is he?
I'm with you kid.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Negative.
Kicker, anything?
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Fuckin A...
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Jesus, God!
I'm pulling, damnit!
Pull me in!
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Give me a break! What happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Where is everybody? What happened?
I get it.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Old woman?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
You okay?!
I'm stuck!
Rizzo, pull away!
I know you.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
I think so, why?
Did you like it?
I think I had some when I was eight.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rizzo, you okay?
You'll be fine.
Okay, good tip.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Eat me.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Oh sure, all the time.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
You?
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Not so bad.
See? We're not so bad.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
I couldn't save them.
And what happend to ...?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Were you close to your father?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
I thought you meant...
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
That's why I'm here.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
What's this?
Hey!!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Hey.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Rizzo?!
What if we don't?
What if you miss?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
We're screwed!
I guessed.
Med-kit?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
No you don't!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Outta here?
I hope so.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
We have to get off this ship.
Where are you going?
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Oh I like her a lot.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
That's really funny.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
She needs a little time.
Well?
She broke my fucking nose!
Spunky . . .
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
It's time.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Now what?
Shut up, Thorgan!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Well, do something!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
I'll help you in.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Okay?!!
Again?! Jesus!
Kaboom.
I'm on my way.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
He's right behind us!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
We're screwed.
Yuck.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
NO!
Close the fucking door!
They'll make it.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
He was chasing me!
You lost the charge?
I...I don't know what I did...
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
Push off toward us.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
You must shut down the engines.
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Now this is getting exciting.
GO, GO, GO!
Now that's just gross.
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
And what's with the headgear?
Thank you.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Just get us to the ship!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
I'm missing two!
You're leaving me here alone?
You're so bossy.
Would you?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
So what else is new?
Hurry! She's lost it!
Let's just get out of here.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
That ought'a help the situation.
I'm gonna spew.
Small brains make your balls itch?
This is what it means right here.
Crutch?
What do we do?!!
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
What are you doing?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Jesus!
You prefer an apple?
Later.
You're quicker than usual.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
I don't know...sorry?
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
I'm just saying.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
No.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Maybe she tripped.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
You killed him?
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
Are there any other shuttles?
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
You need to get laid!
I'm surrounded by idiots.
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Barbie from hell...
Kay-em 14.
Robot huh?
I love you.
I missed you too.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Kay-em you okay?
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
Kay-Em we made it!
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Oh, alright.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Do I have to?
Good point.
Who are you apologizing to?
Sorry, sorry.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Ow!
Almost done.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
It's just you and me, then.
Sory...
Am I in there?
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Oh shit! There he is!
I didn't say I was good at it.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
No! He's coming with us!
Leave him behind!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Kicker!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
We're missing two of the kids!
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
But?!!
I gotta go back.
What?!!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
Thirty seconds.
Then open the doors!
The power's back up!
Keep trying!
Something's wrong.
I just know.
How do you know?
Ssh.
What?
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
I don't understand...what does he want?
See you then . . . doctor.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
I'm sending you the files.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Three...two...one...
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
You're crazy!
How do you open the damn door?
4You're not going anywhere.
Guys, please come with me!
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
More soldiers?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
What good will that do?
Are we locked down?
You wanna die?
You're not going anywhere.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Get him out of there!
Azrael can you repeat that?
I didn't say he was alive.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Are you finished?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
That's right, now if you could...
But...I...400 years?
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
30? How long was I out?
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Nanotechnology.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Obviously so.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
It's okay.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Sure but what good will that do?
Can we get through these?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Yes!
Exactly.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
What have I done?! Idiots.
What have you done?
Old Earth?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Hockey player? He's not a ...
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
