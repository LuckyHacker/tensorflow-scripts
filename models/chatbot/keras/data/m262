Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Yes?
The small one.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
How high up would you say that is?
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Where's the boy?
... Very good, sir.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
... Murderer...
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
What are you talking about?
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Take me. Let the boy go.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Is this what you wanted?
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
What is that?
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
I loathe bats.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
How'd you find this place?
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
... How long have I been out?
... Where are you taking me?
Thank you, Vicki.
I'll take you with me.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
I won't let you have it.
Please.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
I'll have to ask you for that film.
Well -- I think you might consider
...Not even a 'thank you'?
... A hundred and eight?
How much do you weigh?
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Can't we --
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
What about the girl?
Shouldn't we --
I know. I called them.
Look! Police!
WHICH CAR?
GET IN THE CAR!!
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Do you want a drink?
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
What is it you want?
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
What now?
Got it!
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Finding out where she is.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
... Where are you calling from?
Keep her on the line!
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
I feel naked without it.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
No one would miss me.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
I wish you'd...
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
... Looks like a convention.
All street mimes should be executed.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
I don't sing very well.
... We could try that.
Maybe we should just kiss.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
... Terror.
What did you see?
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
Odd desire for anyone.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
No.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Do you sail?
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
As far as I know.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
MOVE! Can't you do something??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Boss! Jesus! They've --
WHAT??
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
Take 'em! I want his head!
We got 'em!
About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
What are you talking about?
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
My brother's a priest, man.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
What are you, scared of heights?
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Is that what you "heard"?
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
I understand.
Because I want someone I can trust.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
That's it.
That's it?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
And what happens if we say no?
I've considered that possibility.
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Joker here. Can we talk?
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
What?  I improved her a little...
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
... Why the mask?
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
... Behind the makeup?
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
And you want a --
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
... Thank you.
Holy shit. Holy...
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
You okay?
HOLY SHIT!!
Great. How??
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
It's gone.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
He's not crazy.
Not what?
Allie, he's not.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Alexander... I know you.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Are they paying you for all this?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
You are on drugs.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
Oh, Bruce...
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Peanuts?
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Yum, yum.
What were you thinking?
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Holy shit...
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
No.
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
How'd you know it was me?
