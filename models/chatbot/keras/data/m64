Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
We should go now.
I will protect you.
The killer is still out there.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
No, no, they're all dead...
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
Good night, Brenda.
Good night, Alice.
I guess...
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
I was careless.
Melvin Belli.
Right! Right!
Tomorrow is another day.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
What'd you see?
Sure.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Thanks, Alice.
Next Friday.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
You want to leave?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Any particular reason?
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You draw very well.
You told her to sweep the courts.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Cabin B is ready.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Wet. I don't know.
What's the matter with it?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Hey, guys!
Marcie?
Jack?
Okay.
I'll go check on Brenda.
They're off now.
Where?
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
I'll go take a look.
It sounded like Brenda.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I don't hear it anymore.
Absolutely.
Help you clean up?
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Good point.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Trouble?
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
How the... did he get in there?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
You can only do what you can do.
Almost five.
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
I don't know.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
It still hurts?
Artist.
Filmmaker.
You're right. It makes no sense.
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
Maybe I can help?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
How come you're leaving?
You okay?
Oh, my God...
Un-hunh.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
Alice? The others show up?
I finished the boats.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Sure.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I'm sorry.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I'll be along.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
How come?
I need you so much, Claudette.
Let's go back, Barry...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Somebody's there, Barry.
No, they won't...
Somebody'll see.
Claudette...
Oh, you...
I wouldn't know.
I can't, Barry...
You know what I said, though.
I meant everything.
You said we were special.
Where's Ned?
You just had some lucky shots.
I'll spot you five points.
Chance to get even?
Get behind him more.
Roll him over!
Is it stuck?
What is it?
A short somewhere.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Thanks.
I had to.
You saved my life.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Here we go.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
For sure.
Give me a hand?
Where'd you get that stuff?
What the hell?
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
That was the telephone.
What hath God wrought?
Whatever you make yourself.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Holy shit...
Dancer.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
I don't believe you...
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
It's gonna be a long summer.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Jack?
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Ow!
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Ha!
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Whassamatta?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Umhummmmph.
Best over...
Mmmmmmmph.
Mmmmmmmph?
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Are you wet?
Lead the way!
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
I call it my shower dream.
It's just a dream.
You? The brick?
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Looks like a storm.
I guess...
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Don't call him.
Ned!
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
I don't love Neddy.
What about Neddy?
I love you.
I love you.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Good call.
How about our last jay?
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Those things can be nasty.
You okay?
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Rocky Road.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Okay, Fireman.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Cowboy.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
It's beautiful...
There you are dead wrong.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
For two lonely nights.
That's thirty percent.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
I mean...
One night on the town.
How much do I owe you?
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
Aw.
I got to.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Anything else you want?
Yeah.
Another coincidence.
Good luck.
Sure.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Why not?
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
