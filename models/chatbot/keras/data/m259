Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
I guess this mean we won.
You'll never guess.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I think I'll take the stairs.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Alright, thanks.
I will relay the message.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
No, actually I feel worse.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
It's cold.
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
Wrong on both counts.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
We do.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
...four, five.
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
Hanging on every word.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
I'm -- sorry, I --
How could you?  I'm a woman...
"Shreck's."  You --
Where's the fire?
Maybe you're right.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Things change.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
What're you really after?
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
You're not the Mayor.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Admiring your handiwork?
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
... What do we do?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
You first.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Y'mean take off our costumes?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
No hard feelings?
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
What're you doing three dates from now?
Nor I, on the second.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Sure.
Photojournalist.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
And the truth frightened her?
Nope, I told her everything.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Yes and no...
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
"We"?  You and...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Yeah?  Me too...
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
No darker than yours, Bruce.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
Treat to be here.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
Oh.  "Kyle."
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Pouring myself into my work.
I'm tempted.
I'm listed.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Well that's a ... long story ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Yes and no ...
Didn't I say that?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Have we?
We've met.
Yawn.
It does to me.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
What happened?
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Weird, huh?
No.  No glass on the inside.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
One way to find out?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Was.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Your blood, Max.
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
Y'mean frame him?
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
You buy this "blurry" business?
PMS.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Dad!  Save yourself!
Son!
My lips are sealed.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
All is shrill, all is blight...
Silent night, violent night...
... eight, seven...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Ten, nine...
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
I don't.  So, no.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Well it's not working.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Too good?
And a very, very good one.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Working late?  I'm touched.
