What --?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
And what's that?
Except for one little thing.
Um-hmm.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
Really?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
Of course.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I know you knew I'd know.
I knew you'd know.
I know you did.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Do I?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Our guests are waiting.
One last tweak.
I thought you were done?
Fantasizing... about you.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Head hunting.
Where are you going?
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
Your mind is so slippery.
It must have slipped my mind.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Atta, boy!
Atta, girl!
Do it, big boy!
Come on, baby!
And some sandwiches --
We could really use some coffee --
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Much less go outside.
I was eight.
When was that?
He was the last time I saw him.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
We didn't think this through very well.
The Disco Boys.
So who killed him?
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
Really?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
I'm his daughter.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Or even what it looks like.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Let's do it.
Sounds good to me.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
No one will believe us.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Me, too.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
But in fact... you'd found it.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
But you're a superhero.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
I can't.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
The Inscrutable Six?
How about... the Savage Six?
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
He was cute though.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
I'm the Bowler.
Who are you?
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Eat your mustard.
Sure.
Hey... you okay?
Hello?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
I dunno.
What did he mean?
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
I thought you'd never ask.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Think positive.
He'll never make it.
Get on to yourself!
Snap out of it!
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
He's dead.
How's your dad?
Thanks.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
It's me... Elizabeth.
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
That boy's got talent.
Why bother?
Should I kill them?
Superheroes.
What about Captain Amazing?
I got it.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Have you considered my offer?
Ummm.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Frankenstein!
And the light goes out...
So are you!
You're dead.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Against.
Are you with me... or against me?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
They always call the great ones nuts.
You're nuts.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Captain who?
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Stay away!
Roy.
Who?
I saw him walk you home.
What?
You're a spy.
I'd better go.
Remember the cat.
Curiosity.
Then why are you here?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Come here.
Me.
Who's the artist?
Why not?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Hi.
Terrific.
Sure -- I guess.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Really?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
You underestimate yourself.
Just a waitress.
Are you an actress?
Really?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Monica!
Bye. 
What?
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
And what if you get killed?
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
What are you talking about?
I'm going inside.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
At the Frankenstein Center.
Monica, where are you?
It's me.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
I just want to be a superhero.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Me, too.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
What have they got that we ain't got?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Yeah.
It's home.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Have you always lived here?
Roy.
What's your real name?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Who wouldn't?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
It is?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Why?
I admire you.
That was easy. 
Sure.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Yeah.
Date?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Every night.
Alone tonight?
Hi.
Not tonight. 
Or talk?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Good or evil, what's the difference?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
I just know.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Yes.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
Yes.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Now you're talking.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
It is not dead. It is hiding.
My heart died a long time ago.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
When I am sure I am among friends.
When are you going to take off that mask?
You drink too much.
And a skunk stinks!
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
And you are a fool.
You're the Sphinx.
With what?
Cover me!
Not a chance!
I'll drive.
Are you coming or not?
But she still might call!
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
But I just don't feel it.
GET MAD!
Because that's what it is.
This place is built like a fortress.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
So what else has Superman got?
SO WHAT?
But there's still only six of us.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
There's a big difference.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
There's just not enough of us.
Yeah.
You sure that's how you spell it?
Good point.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Have you ever seen him?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
I'm liking this.
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
And it would be the right thing to do.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
What are you talking about?
So when are we gonna have an on night?
We had an off night, that's all.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
LOOK!
Oh don't start that again --
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Come on.
What's that?
He hasn't stolen it yet.
So where's the art?
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Roy --
Oh shut up.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Maybe there was traffic.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Sounds good.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Agents?
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Maybe she's right.
Shhh.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Well they've crawled back out.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
The who?
Wait!... Look!
Let's go.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
See ya tomorrow.
Or flowers.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Who's chicken? 
So you're chicken?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Nah.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Why not?
I can't.
So why don't you just tell her!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
But look at him... and look at us.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
There's a vague similarity.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Hey... he's gone.
Yes, Obie-wan.
Anybody got any?
Firepower costs money.
The Eradicators!
The Obliterators!
Yes.
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
No.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Yes.
But... only when no one is looking.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Ow.
Here you go. 
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
So what can I get you?
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Really?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Wow.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Not yet.
Are you famous?
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
We're superheroes.
You guys going to a costume party?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
You did?
I always knew that you were special.
It is?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
I use it... to fight evil.
But... the silverware?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Mother... it's not what you think!
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
It's on the television.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Oh hi, Mom.
Jeffrey!
Right.
Through there!
Where am I going?
May the forks be with us!
We've got lift off!
With or without him, we gotta go!
It's time.
Great timing!
Oh no.
It's suicide.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
That was too close.
But how do we get in?
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
The bazookas?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Are you sure he's still alive?
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Whatever our name is.
To us!
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
And a social life.
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
The who?
And there's the Sphinx.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Do we have to?
Shut up.
Be a Mohican.
Be a Mohican. 
Sorry.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Or both.
Or Batman --
This looks like a job for Superman --
We may be getting in over our heads here.
The Disco Boys.
Who are they?
This is bad.
Ask her out.
Definitely.
She likes you.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Hi.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
