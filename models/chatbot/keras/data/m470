My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Well... uh... thanks...
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
I... um...
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
I was building a doggy door.
How'd you know that?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I suppose so.
That's Renee alright.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I hear you moved into town.
Pretty much so.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
Yes... why?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
What?
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You sure did...
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
What happened to you?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
What do they do up there?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Out?
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
Is something wrong?
Anywhere but here.
So where're we going?
All set.
All set?
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
What are you talking about?
I'm not hungry.
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Just out.
I'm going out, Dad!
Hey! Where're you off to?
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Who was that?
I still can't believe she's dead...
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I think so.
You alright?
What?
It sucked.
Hey! How was your first day at school?
I'll be fine, Dad.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Sure.
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
What's wrong?!
It's been a few years.
How long ago did this guy retire?
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Zowie...
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Just until he heals up?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Is he gonna be okay?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
All the time.
You ever think about running away?
Go later...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Dies?
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
What do you mean?
It's weird...
Maybe it takes a while...
How can he not have a heartbeat?
You think he'd believe it if he did?
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
He was dead. You know he was.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
Yeah...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
You never get over it.
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
You want me to help?
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
The old Indian burial ground.
What did?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
There's a better place...
Why not?
I'm not burying him here...
Is this a good spot?
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
He pissed me off.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Zowie.
What's his name?
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
I know, Mom.
I miss him too...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
How did it go with your father last night?
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
How long have you been here?
Right here, Mom...
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
