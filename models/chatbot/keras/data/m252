I do.
And I have no idea why.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
I'm sorry about how we --
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
I'll tell her you were here.
She asleep?
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Heart be still.
She's coming over here...
I. Don't. Dance.
With you.
So go dance.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Now it's okay?
He wants to talk to you.
What are you doing here?
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
Landon --
I told him to leave me alone.
I didn't know either.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
That'd be something.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I meant he's a doctor.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I could take after Dad, too.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You sleeping with her?
Yeah.
Were you with Jamie?
Late night.  You?
A late night or an early morning?
No. I won't be long.
To see your father?
Me neither.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Thanks.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
You're fine like that, Mom.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
He wants to show now.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
You saw him?
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
That's over. Way over.
Out with Belinda?
-- I like the car I have.
It could help with a new car --
I don't want his money.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
About a job.
'Bout what?
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
Cuz nothing happened at school.
Why not?
Kelly wouldn't do that.
What if they expel you?
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
Later.
Landon!
Scamming's a strong word.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
It was.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
She's like some Puritan.
Demented.
Deranged.
York Ave.
The address?!
And you don't.  What's she doing in there?
You do --
Don't call him a dipshit.
I'm just wondering --
Hypotheticals --
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
I'm thinking.
I need to whizz.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
Get yourself a glass.
What kind of a man are you, son?
I'm very sorry --
Me.
You.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Who are you?
Yes.
But if you could, you would?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Will you do something for me?
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Can I -- go out?
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
I'll talk to your father.
No.  Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself.  Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
It's gone now.
Better. I was really angry.
How're you doing?
That was read at my parents' wedding.
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
Lower. Same page.
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
Tired.
How you doing?
I was going to fake it.
You know how to waltz??
I'm not going back to school.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
That's what I mean.
I've talked to your father.
I don't want to come here anymore.
Now? We just --
That I want you to take me home.
What are you thinking?
I used to like yogurt.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
Nothing.
Anything you want.
Nope.
I will.
Help me live until I die?
All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
Are you frightened?
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
I should have told you sooner --
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
I'm sick.
Jamie --
Where? Why?
Pull over.
What are you going to -- ?
No.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
I'm not applying to college.
You're worried about your college applications.
Yes, one of many.
One of your secrets.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
That what you do?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
I don't care.
From citizen high to citizen low.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
Sure.
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Me.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
What about your father?
Ergo?
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Are you trying to seduce me?
Hoped for it.
You planned this --
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
Mars.
So what do you want to see?
In my back yard.  I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
Where's the one you're building?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
I was twelve.
When did you build this?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
What'd you tell your father?
Look. Talk. Not talk.
What would you do up here?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
How do you know this place?
Away from here.
Where?
Come on.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
What's wr--?
Twice a year.
Assholes. This happen to you?
That. And less strange.
Loved?
You make me feel...
Not possible.
I might do it wrong.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
I don't understand...
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
What do you actually know with religion?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
We can measure wind.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
You're sometimes not sure?
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
You're acting like a crazy person.
Where?
Stand right here.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Fun.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
We're doing something -- ?
Before we do this.
I know you want to.
No.
Your turn.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
It's only 7:30.
I have to get you home by one.
Is there a rush?
I wanted this to be a date.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
I'm not allowed to date.
Why not?
Yes. But not as a date date.
You.
What?
Like fire.
No.  But are you -- impressed?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
She great or what?
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Hey.
It means you can do anything.
What does that mean?!
When I have something to say.
So you're talking to me?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
It's a start.
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
And why would that scare me?
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
You don't know what you want --
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
Prove it.
It's not.
All of it.
That sounds like horseshit.
Maybe you inspire me.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
People can see.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
I haven't been nice to you.
Thank you. So were you.
You were great the other night.
Healthy as can be.
He okay?
Then maybe you can read mine.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That would be the reason.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Yeah --
Oh. Just not at school...
Yes. And?
The play's in a couple of weeks.
You don't miss a thing.
You're not in a very good mood.
I'm really glad you think so.
The play's going to be really good.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
He doesn't trust you.
Your father doesn't like me.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
You don't believe in anything?
You have to believe to have faith.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
No.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Don't you?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
My relationship with God is my own.
Yeah.
In ten words or less?
You're really into God, right?
In 76 years, me neither.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
The dirty snowball at its core.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Looking for something -- someone.
Looking for intelligent life?
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Saturn. Beautiful.
That is my telescope.
What is that?
Could be...
The world of the dead?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
Do you think I'm strange?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Know so.
You think so.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
I know. Don't say anything.
Don't bother!
I'll get something for us to drink --
And you have to meet my father.
No problem --
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Like you'd know.
Ambitious.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
You want to tell me...
It's private.
So what else is on this list?
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
Go for it.
I'll take a chance.
Maybe a little of both.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
You got some kind of list?
Good thing.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Kinda. Yeah.
I'm an enemy?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
What's with the friggin numbers?
So you agree you need help?
What the -- ?!
No. Not like you.
Like me.
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Because that's where the fire is?
Why?
Yeah.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
I know you don't want help.
My act?!
-- Your act only works with an audience.
That's deep --
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
This play -- ?
-- This play means a lot to me.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
'Is it really me?'
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
'They won't.'
'I hope your dreams come true.'
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
I don't want to have any conversation.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
You don't know me.
Were?
Because, growing up, books were my world.
-- Obviously.
I don't make small talk --
-- This your idea of small talk?
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
No. I want what's best for you.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
Dad --
I'm asking how much.
I have expectations, too.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
It was a play.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
No.
Did you give him a gift?
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
Up to?
What's Landon Carter up to?
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
By accident --
He wants help with his lines --
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
She did. It was you.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
Yes.
You're marrying again.
Getting by.
Yes. You?
You've been well?
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I thought she built it herself.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
You know about this stuff?
For the focuser?
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
You have materials for the side bearings?
In there.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
I need to be with her.
I'm not tired.
Landon. You go on home.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Praying.
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
How -- how long does she have?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Either. Both.
Materially or spiritually?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Your parents are divorced?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
How about your family?
You decide.
Like what, sir?
So talk to us about something.
No.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Ever again.
This week.
I don't want to see her hurt.
I care for her.
That won't be possible.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Yes, sir.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Lead man.
You're in the play?
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
You came here to give me my report card?
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
I didn't say you did.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Where did you get -- ?
For Jefferson High. For books.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Then you remember more than I do.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
You don't. That's the point.
When do I get time for me?
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
I'd work backstage or something?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
For pay?
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Please.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
I'd do that --
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
I want to come back.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
Now I can do what I want.
That's right. You just act like one.
I'm no dummy.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
Scalene?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
A similar triangle?
So what did we just make?
Are you?
Yeah.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
