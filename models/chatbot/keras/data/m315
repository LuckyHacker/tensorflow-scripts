Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Not really...
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
What of?
Sell maps?
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
I need something to keep me awake.
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
How will we interrogate them?
They don't speak English...
No one available.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
His wife.
The other one?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
What's he doing here?
Spinning backwards?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
How long have you been here?
I'm afraid so.
Was that for real down there?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
What is this place?
Just like that?
In there.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
Please, they'll kill me...
You are mistaken.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Loose ends?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
He's seriously disturbed...
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Just visiting my patient.
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
He tried to kill me!
Police.  Nobody move.
Yes, sir.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
How could you have been so stupid?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
I see...
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Lost something?
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Why do you want to speak to him?
Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
I see.  One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Yes.  This way.
Good evening, sir.
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Put it through...
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Who is it?
Well be more careful, please.
Why, yes.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Iím sorry...
How can I submit this?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
It seems fine.
Wrong?  Look at this!
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
You typed this report?
Fine.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Good.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Iím your new assistant.
Patricia Crenshaw.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Sorry, sir.
Dammit!
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
What now?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Where do you think this goes?
Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
Go on.
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
What?
They didn't have faces.
Don't know much, do you?
Don't know that either.
Why are they after you?
I don't know who they are.
Who?
People...  after me.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Why give yourself up?
Shut-up.
Where are we going?
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
But...  How long has this been happening?
No...  No doctor...
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
What is going on?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
What?  Who has?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Not that.  Anything else.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
It must be a closet or something.
Where does it lead?
Yes.
You see it?
No.  Have a look.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Which one?
What is that door?
Look!  This is a good one!
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
I didn't realise...
Wait, this isn't fair...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
But I...
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
Please...
Shut up!
Donít kill me!
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
Then we must call the police.
Someoneís after me.
You seem restless.
No.  I, ah...
We are...  living in their dreams...
What is it?
I'm...  being...  punished.
What happened to you?
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
What are you hiding?
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
It's a trick.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
Why?
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
You've been working too hard.
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
Not that again...
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
No, it's the truth.
You're a liar!
You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
I have to go...
What are you doing?
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
I'm sorry.  About before.
Maybe.
Can I get my life back?
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
I'm nothing then.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Horrible...
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Well...
Known me for long?
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
If you like.
Tell me about them...
Yes.
Bad dreams?
That's what people keep telling me.
Your name is John White.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
What does she say?  The woman.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Water?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You know something about me?
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
That's easy.  You...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
They're dead, John.
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
How do you know I'm innocent?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
