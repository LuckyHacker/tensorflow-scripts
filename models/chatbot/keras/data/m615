Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Oh, shit.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Now wait a minute!
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Poppycock!
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Victor Frankenstein.
What was your grandfather's name?
No!
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
And who might you be?
You have the wrong house.
Frederick Frankenstein?
... No!
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir?
Carlson!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Give him an extra dollar.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
From your office, sir.
Where did you get this cauliflower?
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
Yes, sir.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
I did, sir.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
MMmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Is it that music?
MMMmm!
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMMmmmm.
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Baack!
What?
Baack!
What in God's name are you doing?
I...
Miss me?
Well... yes.
Surprised?
Hello...?
Darling!
That's my good boy.
Good night.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
I suppose you're right.
Is it worth taking a chance?
That's a tough choice.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
I suppose you're right.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
All right then!
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Why does he call you 'master'?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
What a strange fellow.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Ready, darling?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Darling!?!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Love me?
Surprised!
Surprised?
Darling!
Darling!
Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
You bet your boots it does.
Does that mean you love me?
You're incorrigible!
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Whatever makes you happy.
I hope you like large weddings.
Oh, nice.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Very....very!
Will you miss me?
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
I promise.
Promise??
Yes.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Yes, don't worry.
And your passport?
Yes.
You have your tickets?
Of course.
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Good.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Will there be anything else?
Well... we'll see.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
This is the only library I know of.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
There seem to be quite a few books.
May I have it, please?
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
Yes!... the laboratory.
You mean... the laboratory??
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
It seems fine.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
One week at the most!?
Yes, sir.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
I didn't do that.
Break that old man's violin.
What?
Why did you do that?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
A week.  Ten days at most.
How long will this whole thing take?
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Fron kon steen!
Dr. Frankenstein?
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
But your grandfather's work, sir...
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
But, sir...
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Nineteen, sir.
How old are you, young man?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
My father was a sick man.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Vermicelli.
A piece of what?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
I beg your pardon?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
It's the only way.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Is everything ready?
Come on, big fellow!
I'll bet it's a doozy.
There's only one way.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
That sound good, boss.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
What???
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
What monster?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
I'm a failure.
That's what we're paid for.
Thanks...for all your help.
Maybe...if you get here on time.
Can you play it?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
All right -- where is she?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Where is he?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
What did you find out?
How's it going?
Act casual!
Yes, Master!
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
No, no!  That whole thing!
... I'm glad that's...
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
I'm not trying to be funny.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Why?
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Yes.
You can say that again.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
Original.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Don't fall for that one.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
It wasn't me.
But you did -- I just heard it.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Who are you talking to?
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You can't win 'em all.
Wait till he sees the bill.
Throw the third switch!
What?
More, do you hear me?
What?
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
This guy means business.
Throw the second switch!
You've got it, master.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Tonight?
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
All right... elevate me!
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Thank you, Master.
If you like -- just hurry!
It's always been one of my favorite names.
Why?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
That's not bad.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Hmm!
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
Was he any good?
I want that brain.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I have a pretty good idea.
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Could be raining!
How?
Could be worse!
What a filthy job!
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Taking the book along?
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Must be the music room.
What is this place?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
Did you see anyone else down here?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
Did you hear that strange music?
Just putting up some tea.
But what you were doing?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What are you doing here?
Fro-derick!
Aye-gor!
I wonder what's got into them?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Home.
Home!
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
The wockers with the knockers.
What wockers?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
No.
I thought you wanted to.
Why are you talking like that?
There wolf!  There castle!
I beg your pardon?
There.
What hump?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Yes, just the two.
Are these your bags?
How do you do?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
I'm sure we will.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
But they told me it was Ee gor.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
You must be Igor.
I see.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
No, Fred ereck.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Are you putting me on?
Fron kon steen!
Frederick Frankenstein?
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
MMMmmmmmm.
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Get the sedative ready!
... It's.
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
Hello there.
It's alive!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Ja, ja.
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Oh, just a little.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
May I see your violin?
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
What's that tune that you're playing
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMmmmmm!
Are you ready for me?
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMmmm.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Yes, I will.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Yes, I know.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes...yes, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Yes, I have mine.
But, after all, you have yours.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
And Elizabeth has hers.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Nor to Elizabeth.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
What?
Of course not.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
I know Frederick.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I see what you mean.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Not fooling around.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Just passing through the night.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Good night!
Good night, Doctor.
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
I think so.
Did you do it?
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Give him the sedative!
Are you serious??
All right -- give it to him!
Stop -- singing!!!
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
This is not the finals -- just sing!
I'd be so nervous.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Me?  Sing?
Do you think you can sing it?
I think I'll...carry him.
What are you going to do?
What do you think we should do?
It looks that way.
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
I think you've done it, master.
Oh, Doctor!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
It wasn't me.
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
I thought it was wonderful.
Reputation.  Reputation!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Right here?
I know.
Yes!
A god?
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
And look at this, Doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, doctor!
But who was playing it?
Well, this explains the music.
Look, Doctor!
What a filthy mess.
Ooh!
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Inga, wake up!
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Inga!
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Would you like a sandwich?
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Well...
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Are you busy?
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
How nice.
Extremely well.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.

Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Yes.
Three minutes to go!
Four
How long is it so far?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
How do you know they're done?
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Look how far we've come.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
I'm getting tired.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
His schwanzstucker.
His what??
There must have been someone else down here then.
No, not sound.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
Foooooood!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Drink!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Food!!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!
Yes, sir, name, please?
