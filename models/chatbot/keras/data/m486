Yes....
Mia...?
What was her name?  The one I met.
Excuse me???
What was her name?
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
You did miss --
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
You did.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Dad...
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
You taking any medication?
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.

What did it want?
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Of what?
How?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
A quantum one.
What universe are you in, Paul?
Could be.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
We flopped the first time out.
It's an experiment.
Why am I doing this?
That's the physicist's playground.
A place you've never been.
Where to?
Could you?
I could go out of town.
What?
Okay.
I'm heading out of town.
Could we go somewhere?
Day or night?
I've been dreaming about you.
