Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
What's that?
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Bye.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
What now?
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
Is it hurting, dear?
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
frowns at Henry.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Look who I've found!
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Come on through.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Look, Mother!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
You have it.
That's enough, Yvonne!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
Love, you can still write to each other.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
stands and walks toward the door.
You have to let me go!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Open this door!
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
is very angry.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
I'm educating myself!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
Who cares!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
What does old Stew want?
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
My name is Gina!
steps back.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
Can I go now?
sighs.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, sit up.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
He's the manager!
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
 Got an A, Mum!
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Hello!
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
Fruit.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Hello!
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
looks startled at the outburst.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
That's coming along well!
Thank you so much!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
hurries over.
I'm so happy to see you!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Isn't it beautiful!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Bye, Dad.
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
All right, then.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Mummy!
Mummy!
I know what to do about mother.
Yes . . .
I'm coming with you.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
But that's not true! I've got one.
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Poor Father . . .
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
That was what we were led to believe . . .
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Just a couple more . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
You mean travel by ourselves?
Let's go overseas . . .
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I think I'm going crazy.
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
How do you know? Did he tell you?
That idiot boarder?
John has fallen in love with me!
What??
You'll never guess what's happened!!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
You're such an incredible woman.
I shall call him Diello.
What???
It's so beautiful!
What?
God, yes!
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
That . . .
That.
This . . .
This.
Him . . .
Him.
He . . .
To be known as He!
Saint Mario!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
But, we're all going to Heaven!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
I think I'm dying . . .
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
It doesn't matter.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
Somebody's got to help us!
She's terribly hurt . . .
Mummy!
Mummy!
