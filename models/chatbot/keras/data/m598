<u>Hello</u>.  What?
It's the White House.

Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...

And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe.

...the Harvester... 
What rig?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
No, no, no...
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...

Oh, Lord....
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
He's not fine.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.

The Hostages...?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...where is the Back End coming from?
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
What did Albania ever do to us?
Precisely.
...<u>nothing</u>...
What do you know about them?
Why?
Yes.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
<u>Who</u>?
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
...they sound what?
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Why?
...that's the general idea.
...you want us to go to War...
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...but...
Who's gonna tell'em.
Yes
The American "people"?
...the... 
Who would find out?
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
What's it gonna cost? 
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
Tell me again.
....we landing?
Tell, tell, tell me again.
I'll see you at National.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.

What is it?
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
I'm working on it.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
What would do that...?
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
It won't hold.
And you?
<u>Do</u> it...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
What crisis?
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
We're going to have to explain away the...
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
All I need is the one day.
It won't hold.
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
When do we bring'em back?
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Who's got the story? 
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Who we got here...?
And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
Quite touching.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.

Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."

...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.

This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"

Where is he?
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Hello...?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
We're locked into Albania.
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
...what is this?
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
Whaddaya think?
Heavy weather East of here.
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
We're due at Andrews. 
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
I have.
Would you go to War to do that? 
To preserve their Way of Life.
Why do they go to War?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
Ask it.
I have a question for you.
What's on your mind?
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
S'only got to hold for another few days.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Who're you working for?
My name is Ronald Brean.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...

...why?
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
It can be documented that he displayed the...
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
How much...?
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
Trade Re1ations.
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.

Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...

Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."

Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Big mistake.
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...

Hell of a Ride, Stanley...

Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
All the greater accomplishment.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
...that's right.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Mmm.
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Mmm...

Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...

"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Yeah...?

What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
I saw it on TV.

Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
You can't have a war without an enemy.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,

And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
I never won an Oscar.
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...

How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Is that true?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
The... 
Who?
Why not?
Why Albania?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
...uh ... No, that's...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Remember the Maine...
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?

Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...

What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
Do I know you?
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It's too clean.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
Take ten.
