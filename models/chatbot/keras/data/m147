He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
What do you figure he done with it?
No.
He never told about the money.
He carried on some; kicked.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
No.
Any trouble?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
I'll bet.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
You, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Hm!
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
No, Ben.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
And I won't never tell about the money.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
I will guard Pearl with my life...
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Not even her?
You understand?
Yes, Dad.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Here they come.
Listen to me John.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Where's your Mom?
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
Don't!
Uncle Birdie!
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
No.
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Leavin', boy?
Just fine.
How's your sister Pearl?
O, she's all right.
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
When'll the skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
I been mindin' Pearl.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
She went.
Where's Ruby?
They hid in a broom closet!
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
I'll light the lamp.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
She went.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Yes! Yes!
And the Lord told that man --
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Yes! Yes!
You have all sinned!
AAA-MENN!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Tricked us!
He lied!
Come on!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Twenty-five wives!
Bluebeard!
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
What can we do, Mother?
A man of the Cloth?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
All to pieces!
Is he hit pretty bad?
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Just went?
I'll be switched!...
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Who?
Sshhh! He's in there.
What's wrong, Mother?
Mother, I only --
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Walt!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
About what!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
How do you mean?
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
So you ain't with the State no more?
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
It's a shame!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
Get along with you.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
You go set down by the River.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
The money, Icey.
What?
There's something else.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
Pearl dotes on him.
John don't like him much.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Fiddlesticks!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
The devil wins sometimes!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
I tried to save her.
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
What!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
How?
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
Amen.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Ah.
Satan.
What could have possessed that girl!
Mister Powell!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Amen! Amen!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Ssh...
Are we goin' home, John?
That's Daddy!
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Hush.
John, where are we g --
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
John?
It'll spoil our supper.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
I'm hungry, John.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
Where are we goin', John?
No, that's just it. No.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Why?
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
To see Dad?
She's gone to Moundsville.
Where's Mom?
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
It's all here.
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Pearl! You ain't --
You what?
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
John! Don't!
You swore, Pearl!
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Hm?
Now can I tell?
Sshhh...
John...
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
The Blue Men?
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
Tell me a story, John.
'Cause you're too little.
Why?
You better not sing that song.
Hing, hang, hung.
Blue men.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
You, Pearl. You swear too.
There! What's so hard about that!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
I'll make coffee.
I'll see to Pearl.
He ain't my Dad.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I mind you said there was two.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Up river.
Where ye from?
Dead. 
Dead.
John, where's your folks?
She talks to herself.
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Don't you hurt her!
Come to me, boy!
Nothin'. 
You could save him, little bird.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Under the stone in the floor.
Now: Where?
Yonder.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Why sure, boy, sure.
Don't you believe me?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
What?
All right...  Come along.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
All right boy: where's the money?
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
I'll tell.
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
I don't know nothin'!
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
Yes. Yes.
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Come on, children!
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
What's that you're playing with, boy?
It -- she --
What's taking you so long about it?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What are you doing, boy?
No. No.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Nothin'!
Tell me what, boy?
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Huh?
Did you hear what I said, son?
Is that all?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Because John said I mustn't.
Why, pray tell?
No.
About our secrets.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Can I have milk too?
Naturally.
Can I have my supper please?
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
I'm hungry.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
John's bad.
Where's the money hid.
All right.
O no! Your turn!
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Yes; John's bad.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
What's your name?
Sure, that's no secret.
That's no secret. I'm five.
How old are you?
What secret shall I tell?
Now it's your turn.
Yes?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Yes?
I'll tell you a secret.
Mm-hm.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Ahh!
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Pearl and John.
What's their names?
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
No. No one never did.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
O' course.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Can I have this?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
What do you figure to do?
She turned me out of the bed.
How's that?
Our honeymoon.
The first night?
Yes; from the first night.
Didn't you have no inkling?
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Mister Powell?
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Answer me!
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
I'm through, Harry.
Are you through praying?
Yes.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
I -- no, I --
Do you want more children, Willa?
Get up.
Harry, what --
Get up, Willa.
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
No, Harry! I thought --
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
I was praying.
Harry!
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
None of your business, Madam.
What are you after them for?
Them kids!
What do you want?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
What's wrong, John?
What's wrong, John?
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
The Lord will provide.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
She took them kids with her?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Where's she at?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Where's your Missus?
My flesh and blood!
Them kids is yours?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
How'do.
Mornin', ladies.
The man! The man!
What?
Miz Cooper!
John and Pearl!
Pearl and John.
What'd you all talk about?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Now who was this?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
I been out with men.
What you been up to?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
The Drugstore?
This man down at the Drugstore...
When did I ever?
You'll whip me!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
I been bad!
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
Pearl and John!
