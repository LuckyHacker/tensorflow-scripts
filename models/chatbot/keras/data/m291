I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
This is one way.
Any place.
Where do you think you're going?
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Taking messages.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
Don't you have children?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Was someone in an accident?
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You gotta just look the other way.
Then whose is it?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Will you two cut it out?
Did you have to tell her my name?
Theo wants to talk again.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
How was I in the wrong?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
Say something ...
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
I didn't hurt you.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
You could've made me lose my call.
What was that for?
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Who's on the phone?
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
You could've killed us.
Are you guys all right?
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
I told you I should've cuffed him.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
Can you make him stop!
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
You missed.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
Or relieve me of it later.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Yes sir.
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Lady, don't let him do it!
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
What's this?
I'm going to level with you officer.
Let's have your license, mister.
Why would I do that?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
You never miss a trick.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
He's seen both of us now.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
What do you keep making me out to be?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
Got your badge?
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
I improved on the fucking original.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Make a "U" and go back.
And stop with the directions.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
If you know that just back off.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
That's your "rep."
Bullshit.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
Not this minute.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
It's taken care of.
You switched license plates?
Give me 20 minutes at least.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Any minute.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Nels?
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Allow me.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Lose the hardware now.
What am I supposed to do?
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I thought you said you could handle him.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I don't want it.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Five ... six.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
You won't live to see it.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Know what else is in here?
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Took preparation.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Both hands on your lap.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
I'm handling it.
That's how it's going to be.
That's not good enough.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Only one way to find out.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Naturally.
Naturally.
You're the man with the gun.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
What's your point?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
That's a reasonable possibility.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
How about "later?"
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
Why are we stopping?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Think you could do a picture of me?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
They did some great job of reforming you.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
Any idea where you're going?
The money, Nels ... ?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
What's happening?
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Ask them.
Do you think they'll walk away?
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
259-7881.
What's Nels' number?
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
Did you hear that?
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
He wants 75 back.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
I'm still okay.
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
Stop talking like that!
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
You wouldn't --
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
You could've hit me.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
You're enjoying this too much.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You, I would've noticed.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
What's that supposed to me?
A typical fuck-up.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
Do you have to point that?
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
L.A.P.D.
Who's in back?
You knew about me.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
I thought it was inspired.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
You timed that beautifully.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
At least one.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Damned if I know.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
The guy with the transplant.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
Whose money is this?
There isn't any such person.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Hand me the phone.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
They put their hands all over me.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
You're going to let them get away with this?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Now I have -- it's a long story.
Include me in that.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
It's locked.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Why can't it be her?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Can you walk?
Yes.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
I can't do it.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Put the man back on.
Yes sir.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes.
You're all three of you in that van?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Your husband?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Are you okay?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
God, if he doesn't come back --
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
What did you do?
Lucky for them they didn't.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Yes?  Yes?
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Did you hear that click?
No.
Did you jiggle the phone?
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
You can't give up.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Why tell me this?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
It won't be him.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
What's going on?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Do you know what's in that box?
Don't say that.
Not a chance.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Black Mercedes, 600S.
What do you mean?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
The City National on San Vincente.
What bank?
The one in Brentwood.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
I'm trying to.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
She's gone --
What's happening?
I've got to ask somebody.
No.
Does she wear glasses?
That's not her.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
That makes two of us.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
A price on everything.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Pictures.
Our house always needs touching up.
Sometimes I paint.
What do you do for a living?
Well you did.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
And that was the end of it?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Hey drop it, okay?
A woman?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
How much time do you have left on it?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Tell me what she looks like.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
What are you doing now?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What about the others?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Another minute.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
26th off Wilshire.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
"Theo?"
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
What do they need her for?
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Stop throwing names at me.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
I'm with two friends now.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Shit!
Please.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Who?
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
What makes you say that?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
No -- nothing.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Where'd they take you to?
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Then hang up!  Do it!
Don't lay this on me!
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Oh won't I?
You won't disconnect.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I don't want to know --
My name is --
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I don't believe you.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
Who smashed the phone?
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
Lady, try making some sense.
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
And what're you whispering for?
Will you let me explain!
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
You don't understand.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Do I know you?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Didn't we play this scene before?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
You mustn't hang up.
Who is this?
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Put the girl on.
Seems like it.
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
Don't worry.
Count it.
I'm backing up.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Stop the crying.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Are you trying to panic the women?
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
I won't let 'em.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
And then?
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
And not a nickel.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Negative.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
My pleasure --
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
You should've done all this before.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
It's in the process.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
We're waiting on you.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
I still don't see you.
I don't know what you mean.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
Satisfied?
Talk to the man.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
You'll see her.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Just relax.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
It's your call.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Stay there.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
We don't see you.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I wish it had never been invented.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
308-9962.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Sure.
Got a phone in that van?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Some loyalty.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
We can be there.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
What time frame have you got in mind?
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Pass.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Where do we meet?
Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
There are no guarantees in this life.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Keep talking.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
They saw you kill the driver.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
You're making it too easy.
Whatever you say.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Twenty percent.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Who are you working for?
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
I'm in awe.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Who were you talking to?
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
In your dreams.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Where's the backpack?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
How do you know?
We're gonna get there first.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Where do I turn?
Five minutes.
How far off are you?
Take the 405 south.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
I can see the benefit in that.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
What does it take to kill you?
I thought you'd know me by now.
Who's this?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Yeah?
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Yeah?
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
There's two police cars now.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
The fuck I will!
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
Call me "Nels."
Who am I talking to?
Better reassure him.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Why are you picking on me for?
Mind if I have a look?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Seems not.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Let her tell you.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Hold on.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
There's no lady here.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Who are you?
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
From here on, I dish it out.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
The 405 is coming up.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
I thought so.
Undercover.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Government business?
Can I make a quick call?
Doesn't everybody?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
I already called for an ambulance.
