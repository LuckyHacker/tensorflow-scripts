Execute!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Tractor beam, aye!
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Status!
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Scotty...?
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
What did you see, Chekov?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Still no response, sir.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Aye, sir.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Nothing. As before.
Response?
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Will we get another ship?
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Chekov -- ?
On screen.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Locate.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Aye sir, coding now.
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Not from here, no.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Why don't we beam it up?
What is it?
I don't believe it...
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Could it be Spock's?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
David, I don't understand...
I went wrong.
David!... What went wrong?
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
David... Sorry I'm late.
Hello, sir. It's David.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
I'll go...
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I still don't...
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I don't understand.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
... How long?
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
This planet is aging in surges.
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
Did your collaborator know?
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Why?
Not exactly.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I have already made one transmission too many...
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
That may be difficult...
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Logic indicates that is the case.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Later. Let's go...
Spock's burial robe.
What is it?
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
David --
.          .. Spock's tube...
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
My readings indicate great instability.
I'll handle that later.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Short range scan.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
A photon tube...!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Underground deposit?
Same sector. Metallic mass.
It's a little early to celebrate.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
... Fascinating.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Captain, what's happening?!
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
None that I can detect, sir.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Do you have an explanation?
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
You said there wouldn't be any.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Just him, sir!
How many more?
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
What's wrong?
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Good shooting, Scotty.
Aye, sir!
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Aye, sir!
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Sir...?
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Mr. Scott?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Mr. Scott...
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Much is at stake...
My God...
. He will remain always as he is.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
What? What are you saying?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
Goodbye, David.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
What happened...?
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
The ship... Out of danger...?
Yes, yes, Spock...
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Why would you do this...?
You would have done the same for me.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Yes. And I know you.
I know you... Do I not?
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Go, Sulu!
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Come on!
Close... There --
What about surface life signs...?
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
With some on the planet...
About a dozen officers and men.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
... A cloaking device?
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
See! That shimmering area.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
I'll need it, Sulu.
Count on our help, sir.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
The word, sir?
She's to be decommissioned.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Would you look at that?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
No, sir, no response.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Any time.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Yours...?!
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
May I ask why...?
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Genesis?! Whatever for?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Indisposed, sir.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Welcome home, Jim.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!

Give me your hand and we both live.
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Genesis, I want it.
Because you wish it.  
But, why?
No.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!

Wait! Give me a chance --
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
David?... David!
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Torpedoes coming in -- !

Report status!
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
What I have done, I had to do.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
What about Spock?
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
What you ask is difficult.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What must I do?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Bones!...
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
Yes... But -- how...?
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... Spock...
... Or the one.
... The needs of the few...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
Yes...
... He spoke of your friendship.
Of course...!
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Then, how --
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
But -- why?
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Yes, I was...
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
I -- saw no future --
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
How can you tell that?
They know we would die first.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I ordered no interruptions.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Sir, may I suggest --
Station!
Success, my lord.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Understood, my lord.
Share this with no one.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
So!  Speak!
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Sir, may I --
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
My Lord... what are your orders?
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.

500 Kellicams!
Wait!... Wait...
1,000 Kellicams, closing!

Firing range, sir.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Yes, my lord!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
All true.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Good for you, Lieutenant.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
How is that...?
You amaze me, Commander.
