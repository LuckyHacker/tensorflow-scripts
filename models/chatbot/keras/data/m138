Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
You want to come inside?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Is there something else I can do for you?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Who told you we deal drugs?
And you don't deal drugs?
We like to think so, yeah.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Have a nice day.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Mm hmm.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
I can make my own decisions.
Mother!
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
I'd love to.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Mm hmm.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Aaron?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
What's wrong?
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Mother, I ...
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
You know, you never tell me anything.
I don't want to talk about it.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
But I was dusting.
Behind the books.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Mother!
You know ...  ... whoops!
What pictures?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Dating anyone?
I'm good.
How are you doing sweetheart?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
... What are they all doing there?
Uh-huh?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
You don't like where I live?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
So, what do you think?
... Manly?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
He's an organic farmer.
What does he do?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
What happened?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Really?
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Who is it?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Forty-five all total.
I see.  How much?
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
This way?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
You mean it's dangerous?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Moscow.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Yeah.
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
... Oh ...
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
So, you come here all by yourself?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
And where is she?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Where to?
