Get the kit!
Oh my god, oh my god...
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
How can you tell?
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Thank God.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
How long's this been going on?
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
I sure as hell hope so.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
No, nothing.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Meanwhile...?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
You crazy? Hit him with what?
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What!?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
How you plan to do that?
My dream.
Bring him out of what?
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
You do?
The killer.
Who?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Much better.
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
Hi.
Hello?
Well what you reading it for?
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Great.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
What happens if they don't do that?
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
Yeah.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
No.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Used to. Not anymore.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Yeah. So?
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Okay?
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Uh-oh...
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
You believe in anything?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
No.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Slept like a rock.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Not really.
Haven't slept, have you?
Guess I did.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
You okay?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
What the hell's going on!?
Who was scary?
Because he was scary, that's why.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
It's just a stupid cat.
Jesus.
Worked like a charm.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Deal.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, but...
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Nan, I --
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
You know he's dead though, right?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Hello Nancy.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Dad -- what you doing here?
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
You don't know he did it.
He's dangerous.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Decide to take a day off after all?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
You used me, daddy!
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
What?
She dreamed this would happen...
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
Rod's not a lunatic.
Okay. Hi, dad.
How you doing, pal?
'Anything funny' like what?
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
I don't mean her --
She lived there.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
What's the Coroner got to say?
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Like Rod Lane?
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
How you know that?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Krueger?
Krueger.
Who? Who did that?
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
Feeling better?
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
Just sleep now, Mom.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Give me the key, mother.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Go on...
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
So he's alive?
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Dead and gone.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
S'curity.
What's with the bars?
Nancy!
Screw sleep!
Put that damned thing down!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Go even crazier?
Okay.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
You okay?
Nancy?
I must be going nuts...
Right.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
To bed with you, c'mon.
Great
You okay?
Warm milk. Gross.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Mother, for petesakes.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
What?
I will.
Get into bed.
I won't.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Right home after. See you.
Right home after.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Did you sleep?
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
School.
Where you think you're going?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
It wasn't that serious...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
No.
Do you think I did it?
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
What you mean 'all at once'?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
No.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
And then what happened?
The door was locked from your side.
Someone else was there.
You were screaming like crazy.
I never touched her.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
We should get her out of here...
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
What you dream?
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Nice to have a fire.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Yeah, nuts.
He's nuts about you.
Rod says the sweetest things.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
When did you have a nightmare?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
No more fights.
No more fights?
Jungle man fix Jane.
You feel better now, right?
Of course. What's that?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
What the hell you doing here?
