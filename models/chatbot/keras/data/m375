Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
--No.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
--Stop it--
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
You're so funny...
It's what I do.
You do not.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
What do you do?
Yeah...
Oh... really?
In the corporate offices.
You don't...
Yes I do.
You do not.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
Whatever I can get away with.
So, what are you doing now?
Wonderful.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Don't say that.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
I'm Martin Blank.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Remember high school?
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Computer guy.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
What?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Then express yourself, Bob.
I want to be an actor.
What do you want to do?
What am I gonna do?
You could've been a contender, huh?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
Really?
Never better.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Okay. See you later.
Really...? So what?
It's me. Martin Blank.
What?
Bob...
Overflowing with love.
Jesus...
To make a long story short...
Insane.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Yes.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
Other people can't.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
You kill people. 
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You don't understand...
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
I'll hide.
What if I come back?
I'm staying here.
Will you come with me?
That's probably a good idea.
I was leaving.
You never could have kept this from me.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Jesus Christ!
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
You're a government spook?
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Get the fuck outta here.
...About five years now.
It's something I do...
Is it something you've done?
No.
Not the other way around...?
Yes.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Like love?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like heroin?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
No time.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
--She's not dead---
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Which would you rather...?
We haven't seen each other since high school.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
What?
Shoulda brought my gun.
Right.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Do you want to get a drink first?
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
...Let me get my coat.
Okay... Hold on...
You look beautiful.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
As long as I get the laugh.
Flowers. That's funny.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
You're fucking psycho.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Hello...?
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Yes.
Are you there?
I'll think about it.
Seven it is.
Unbelievable.
Yes.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
That'd be good.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
What's that?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Bad television.
Watched television?
Bad people.
You met people.
Bad experiences.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Well, there's not much to tell.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Yep.
It's always the little things.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
That's part of it.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Are you going to the reunion?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
You see someone?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Where have I been?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Okay.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
I'm a professional killer.
What's your business?
Not much else.
That's it?
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Tell me about yourself.
Here is now there. There is here.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
How long has it been?
It's nice to see you again.
I just play my own collection.
This is me breating.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Out Loud?
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
What else? Say more.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Morality.
What stuff?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Mmm.
Yes.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
You know where I live?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
Say more.
I just know.
How do you know?
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Come on.
You went to school with these people.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Up on the right.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
Okay.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
It's only natural....
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
No.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
You understand the psychology of the job.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
I work alone.
Do you like the people you work with?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
How was your day, today, sir?
Excellent. Here they come.
There you go. I left it blank.
Okay.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Is that right?
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
No deal.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Hard to get good help these days.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
No harm no foul.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Thank you, no.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Like a union?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
What do you want?
I guess.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Nope.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Those all seem kind of related...
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
That sounds pretty interesting...
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Hey, Bob.
Hello, Bob.
Not bad. You?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
No...
Did you see Blank in there?
I get it.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
I love. I kill.
One cannot love and kill.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
He using her.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Yup.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
Wait a minute--
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Whatever.
It was the PLO.
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
--Nooo--
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
I don't think so.
Well?
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
In Portugal, yes.
Lisbon?
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Will do.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
Tell them my house exploded.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
You have.
I've looked at it.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
It's fine.
What's it look like?
I'll do it tomorrow.
This is not good.
See you next week.
Don't forget your identity.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
I have scruples. Next.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
Never enough.
Enough?
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
There's nothing to be done about it.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
They were very upset.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
In Detroit. This weekend.
And they want me to make up for it.
They blame you for the compromise.
He didn't.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
I'm not happy.
They're not happy, sir.
I'll pay.
That's going to cost.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
All of it?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
This?
Throw that away.
Patch him through....
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Yeah...
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Of course you will.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Yeah. I guess we did.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
No, I don't have one.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
You have a headache?
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
I spoke to your father the other day.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
Jim?
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
It's a place where religious people--
What's a revival tent?
That's wonderful, Mom.
I bought a new rug.
See you in ten years.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Work's good for the soul.
I have to get my head back into my work.
That's too bad.
It didn't work out.
As long as you had a good time.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
What the hell happened to you?
Mein Dealer.
He gave me a great deal.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
He sold me this bad boy.
He sells BMW's?
Thank you.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
Ten years. What happened!?
No.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
No. You drove us here.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Debi's house.
You too.
God it's great to see you.
Fair enough.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
So what happened to you?
You're leaving me hanging here...
Paul?
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Wow.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
How did you get this job?
To shoot you. Correct.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
That's good.
I'm a professional killer.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Why not?
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
How's that?
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
How are you? How's business?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
