You expect me to believe that?
Yeah.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
You don't mind?
Okay.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Can't afford to take chances.
What's going on?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Oh yeah?
He said not to tell.
Gone?... Where?
Well, he's gone.
Hi. where's Cato?
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
No, he showed me one.
That's what he told you, huh?
She plays the clarinet, too.
Yeah, I guess.
They come with the house.
Where'd you get them antlers?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
What you been doing?
Not bad.
How you doing, Cato?
What do you mean?
Catch!
He never bit me.
Does he bite?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
What do you feed him?
Yeah.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
What'd they look like?
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You lost that one?
I used to throw trash for the City.
You ever held another job before?
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
I mean it.
Thanks.
Good luck to you.
Tom...
Well, Kit...
Sure.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure thing. Come on.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Then why'd you do it?
They're okay.
You like people?
Mmmmm.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Nope.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Thirty aught six.
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
We did it, Ray.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Oh yeah?
Cause I can't allow it.
Yeah? Why not?
No, you're not either.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
What for?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
What're you doing?
Hi.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Yeah.
Is that right?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
What'd you come out here for?
Sure is pretty.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Yeah. I can imagine.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
I don't know.
You love him?
Jack.
What's your friend's name?
Okay.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Yeah.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
What?
I just don't want to go.
Have you got a better idea?
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Yeah.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
What?
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
No.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
How about over here?
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
It was going too fast.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
I'm serious.
Everybody loves trout.
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
That's Montana over there.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
I don't blame him.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I'd like to get out of here.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Yes.
Positive?
No.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Don't.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Excuse me.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
I don't want a steak.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Yeah.
You tired?
Just to keep him out of the sun.
What'd you put him in there for?
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
I don't know.
Think I got 'em?
Just looking.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Is he upset?
I got him in the stomach.
How's he doing?
Look at all this junk.
Put that down. It's dirty.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
He was nervous.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Yeah, me too.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
How you doing?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Why?
You said that once already... Too late now.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Are you sure?
Well... I don't think that'd work.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
I can look and see.
How bad off is he?
I came in the front.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
Don't call me stupid.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
But it would hurt.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
What?
You know what I think?
Don't ask me.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Yeah.
Is that all there is to it?
Yeah.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
I don't care.
Somebody else is going to get it.
No.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
My stomach's growling.
It's your play.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
What a nice place.
Okay.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Yeah?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Why not?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
I know.
You're a redhead.
Bring it along.
Well, I got homework.
You want to go for a ride?
I don't know.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Something mi trabajo.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Spanish.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Great.
Quit my job.
Well, stop the world.
Hi.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
There you go.
Nothing.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Yeah.
He'll say that?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Sure.
Can I be honest?
What?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Doing what?
Nah, I got me a job.
You still in school?
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
It's okay.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
What for?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Holly.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
No.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Sure.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
What's that?
Well, he didn't have it last night.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Really?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Hi.
Okay, no monkey business then.
Yes.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Fine.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Yes.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Just thinking.
Hi, whatcha doing?
Stay as long as you like.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
No.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Yes.
This your place?
Yes?
Hi.
Git.
Just gimme a chance.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Who are you?
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
It's mine all right.
You didn't walk out here.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Maybe.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
No.
Wanta sue me?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Beats me.
Think I'll take the juice?
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Hold it right there.
Hi.
