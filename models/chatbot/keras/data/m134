-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
True.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
Yes, I believe he has --
God-Damn you!
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
They have nothing to do with this --
Yes.
There are two million people in there with you.
I need to take back what's mine.
What do you need?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you want?
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
This is Halden.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
Why --
Because I took it out of your memory.
How come I can't remember?
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
She said I have a son...
To live forever.
Why?
It's all been transferred.
Okay...
It's okay.
From the dream.
Wake up?!
It's time to wake up.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
What's happening?
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
But this is impossible.
Just like you always wanted.
Guests?
The guests are here.
Yes.
It's all here...
No...
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Who are you?!
About what?
You were right.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Do you believe in miracles?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Your life that bad?
-- No.
This is how you pick up women --
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
And down here --
Only up there in the dream they called life.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
One would assume so.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Yes.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Dream?!
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Yes...
You were the one who was dying.
Not real?
It's not real.
The new world.
In a computer program.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
In here I am.
You are not a God.
Yes.
Divinity?
So wrong --
Not my problem.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Then what?
No.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
True.  But why?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
-- He will.
But what if he doesn't --
It's his nature.
You sure he's going to come?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
And what about the reconfiguration?
Unfinished business.
Where the hell are you going?
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
The maze has been changed --
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
What about the customers with reservations?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
At least a day.
How long?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long 'till we can eject?
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Take care.
There is no --
The woman you're stuck on.
Who?
What's her name?
The weather.
What?
I'm South Dakota.
New York.
Where you plugged-in from?
If she's alive, you get it back.
Insurance?
Insurance.
Need the disk back!
Times Square.
Where?
An interface attendant.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Then where is she?
There was no need to kill her.
Try harder.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
To hide the evidence.
Why would I do that?
Then you had her killed.
Katie was digitized.
Not his style.
The truth.
What did he tell you?
-- Who did he digitize?!
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Who did he digitize?
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Good question.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
That's right.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
He wouldn't say.
Why?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
It's not used for anything.
A hotel?
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
What is it?
The truth.
What?
One condition.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
And you weren't involved.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
-- I saw the program.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Try harder.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
You're jumping to conclusions.
Go!
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
-- Yes.
He had access to the keys --
-- He won't.
Won't be time if he gets access --
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Two maze runners.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
He had keys.
There was no other choice.
Sorry?!
I'm sorry.
What's the difference?
Not you.  A copy.
But you were with me.
I know.
I wasn't with you.
Way you kiss me.
What?
Yes.
And it meant something.
You weren't real.
Realize?
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
For what?
It was a test.
Why?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Yes.
You said we were on the same programming team.
Her?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Corporation can.
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
Night City.
-- The inside?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Who are you?!
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
What are you talking about?
-- You told me.
Then how do you know about --
No.
You went to my high-school?
-- Katie.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
No.
Someone you have to get back to?
Tanner.
I've got to get back.
Some things never change, do they?
Cleaning up a mess.
What brings you inside?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Just like that --
Just like that?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
There?
It was just there.
Try me.
Because you'll never believe me.
Why not?
This.  No point to it.
What's so funny?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Don't know what you're talking about.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
