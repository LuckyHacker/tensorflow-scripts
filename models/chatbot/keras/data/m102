So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
They hate each other --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
He --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Well, I wouldn't say --
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
You did good, Massey!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Howard!
Baby. You are so HOT!
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Here. Got pictures.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
What part?
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
-- and we are sure...
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I just want to make sure that you both --
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
What a touching story.
I had no idea until after, but --
No!
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
After you, Doll.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
You're in a rush.
Here's her picture...
Is that... one person?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Who do you want me to kill?
Excuse me?
Who's the pigeon?
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Who's the pigeon?
Triple!
That's his lawyer.
No...
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Mr. Dumbarton.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Sustained.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
Mr. Massey?
We rest, Your Honor.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Uh... poetry recitation.
Grounds?
Objection, your honor!
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Marylin! What have I done?
Huh?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Who was that?
So, that's good, right?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Yes.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
What do you mean, was.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Yes?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
What?
My God.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
It's your move, Miles.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
You have the pre-nup?
I have it.
Well... I'm still...
Asian? No.
Is she Asian?
Thanks, buddy.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
He's the wrong man.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
What?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
What?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Got any symptoms?
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
I should be in therapy.
You're in check.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
We did not.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
Set one side for Bel Air.
It was a gift from a client.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
No frown lines.  New watch?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
What the hell is Botox?
You want Botox?
I don't need it.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
What is your husband's profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
I'll be right back.
It sounded like a bell.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Is Tong older than Ming?
I said yes.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
It's about time.
You're vulnerable.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I begged you to have a baby!
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Why do you think she did it?
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
You like kids.
No.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
Ruth Rabino.
So who'd you hire?
I thought so.
Sweet.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Pre-Castro.
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Murder!
Murder?
Income tax evasion?
Forgery? Fraud?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
It's not something I wanted either.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Hello Miles.
Hello Marylin.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
That's true.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
You were going to have this thug...?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Wait! He works for YOU?
It's okay Joe.
Marylin!
It's a no go, Joe.
You do? You do love me?
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
I fell in love Miles.
Please! Leave the house.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
No buts. Now. Out.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
You have to leave the house immediately!
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Marylin?
Hello?
That's marriage.
That's blackmail.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Meaning my house.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You can't prove anything.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Those are gifts.
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
What kind of "stuff?"
STUFF.  Got a light?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I want to nail you ass.
What do you want?
Comfy!
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
I don't believe you have "things."
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
May I come in?
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Miles? You're scaring me.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
You don't like me?
I bet.
I have a surprise for you.
Hello Marylin.
Hi.
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
Miles.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Fabric and fringe.
Good.  Are those foods?
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Honey, I could sit...
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
But?
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
Oh Miles!
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
I have a watch.
I know.
I don't have a ring!
Yes. Again.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Do you want to sleep on it?
No.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
You do?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Did you just propose to me?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Huh?
I want to be your -- your wife.
I want... I want to...
What is it Miles?
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
Friends?
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
No.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
No, we're not!
We're damaged goods.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
Your mother was.
And here I thought my mother was...
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
She held that against you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She didn't love you?
She never particularly cared for me.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Hmmm...
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Me. Yes.
Is that you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
From a -- girlfriend.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Thank you.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Okay Miles.
No. Don't stop.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Screw you, asswipe!
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Marylin? When did I say...?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Yes? Marylin?
Miles?
Hello?
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
To victory.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Have you tried the duck?
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Howard is a beautiful person.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
No, that's not all.
So I hear. Is that all?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
But why him?
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Marylin! Listen to me.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
He's passionate.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Getting married.
Absolutely.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Oh, for the love of...
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
He'll regret this.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
And you've always loved him?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Well, don't look at mine!
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Gotcha.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
He wants a reconciliation.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
No. I haven't. Have you?
You just haven't met the right person.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You don't believe in it.
No.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
I know you do.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
I told you. I was hungry.
Why would you be here?
How do you know?
But you don't agree?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
What does your lawyer think?
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Not yet.
Did you see the tape?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Isn't everything?
I assume this is on Rex?
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
These are yours.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
How nice.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
Sometimes I forget.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
You have some?
Do you need a Tagamet?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Marylin.
Hello, Rex.
Dogs?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Marylin?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
We are. And it's winding down.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
So. Now what?
He was right, wasn't he?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
You used his credit card.
Forgery and Fraud?
Please!
Is this a lover?
Jesus.
Who's that?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
I was devastated. Of course.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I guess.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
So what?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
But you're going through with it?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
What?
Right.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Is this Ming?
I want to be exposed.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Hello Miles.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
You're not...
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
Shit.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
So where are you now?
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
I'm dying.
Every week --
Oh, God!
Lilly's up.
He has a reputation for being tough.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Well what does he want?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I wish I had your discipline.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
We do have a man for you.
Maybe.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Who's she?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Do you know him?
Of Massey Myerson?
Miles Massey.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Wow.
She did a Harriman.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
Excuse me?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Yes?
Wait. I know you.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
She's here now.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Mr. Massey --
When you have a moment.
Herb wants to see me?
We've outlined a settlement...
Where does that leave us?
That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
And it's good!
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
I don't have a pre-nup
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Did Marylin end up with money?
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
...arty farty!
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Heh heh.
Ha Ha.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
That's delusional.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client has ruled that out.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
What?!
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
Maybe I should reconsider my...
In anticipation of making you sick.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She always looked out for me.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
What's Kirshner?
Well -- is that possible?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Nothing?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Video.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
I'm not sure.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I don't know. I can assume...
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Ah.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
But then... But then...
Mm.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Now Rex.
Thank you.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Rex, please.
Mr. Rexroth.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Extinguish?
-- the coin?
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Do you have it?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Miles.
Wrigley?
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
She owes me a meal.
What...?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
HA!
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Miles -- why so angry?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Berry spoons.
What are they?
What do you think?
Is she going through with it?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
No. You're not.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I am very sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Sorry.
Wrigley!
What the fuck...?
Video.
And she has...?
Nothing.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Who's "Patty."
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Hi, Sweetie.
Mother?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
And only two are hers.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
Maybe next time.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Muriel Rumsey.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Who's Rex's guy?
Three is not Farrow.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
