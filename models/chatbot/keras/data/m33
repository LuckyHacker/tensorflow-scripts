Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
I don't think he'd feel it.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Maybe we should bail?
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Getting very weird.
I hope not.
This the right place?
You said that in the last two places.
This should be it...
First decent idea you've had.
Let's grab some food.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
I said let's go, Charlie.
Nick, we can't just --
Let's go.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Hey, when in Rome --
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
I didn't know.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Number five with a bullet.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
No.
Nick... You up?
Where is the subway station, please.
What'd you say?
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
Not a prayer.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
Saving your life.
What are you doing?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Maybe we should do something?
Some party.
The Wolf?
Frank Abolofia.
What?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Who do you think the Jap is?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
What are they doing now?
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
-- I should tear your head off.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Charlie...
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Why?
Get rid of it.
Back-up.
Let go...
What's this?
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Home.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Thanks.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
I think she got to you, pappy.
Hey, all right.
What does Charlie mean?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
You all right?  You okay?
Cool?
You cool, Ich?
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
What'd she say?
Joyce can be nice.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Squid?
I wasn't expecting you.
Are you expecting anyone?
If you give me one.
Give me a break, would you?
You'll take care of that.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
All right, how's the new partner?
Connie...
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Short shift?
How can you be so sure?
We can't lose.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Louder, pal, louder.
Call for help.
Yes...
You all right?
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Why's that?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Luck.
What's that for?
Me too.
I'm sorry.
A wife.  She left.
Thank you.  You have one?
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Someone attacked him.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
I don't know.
Joyce?
I couldn't tell.
How many men?
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
You did great, Ichiro.
Kampai.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
I can't...
Start it.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
No.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Nick, you can't do this.
Let's go.  Him first.
No...
So I bring some cheese?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
What's in the box?
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
It's illegal, Nick.
Big enough.
It's very small.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
What...?  Why?
I want to go talk to him.
A resort city, Beppu.
Where does this Sugai live?
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Nick!
San is an honorable title.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
I want to yank Kobo.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Shut-up.
Nick --
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
I'm not drunk...
You can trust me.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
I'll check it out.
Gaiijin.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
You were too far behind.
She disappeared... shit!
Good.  Very good...
Yakuza.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Ichiro --
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Nick...
Sure.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Are we getting married?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Did I say that?
There she is!
What'd I tell you?
Nick...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
What's he saying?
A snitch?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Know her?
I stole them.
How'd you get this?
I can see that.
I've continued working on the case!
I'll get him for you, Nick.
Yeah...
You must leave?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
Why weren't you at the platform?
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
What happened?
I don't, that's all.
Why the hell not?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Give us a break...
Nick!
What's the problem here?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Where would you look for the mafia?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
I'd like that.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Might be different in New York.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Can't make you change your mind?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
What if I chant?
I still think you're a bastard.
Why would you care?
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
No one's keeping him here.
You'll get Ich killed.
The cheese...
We're in?
Tell them I'm not.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Who am I supposed to be?
They want your autograph.
I don't remember you saying no.
I don't remember saying yes.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
What do you chant?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
You met her.
Where's the wife?
He's got a reason.
He drinks.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
You could fake it.
And I'm supposed to care?
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
I need someone to translate for me.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Unavailable.
Where's Ich?
I need your help, Joyce.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I paid for that.
He's on duty.
Don't be an ass.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
She ever pull down her shades?
I don't think so.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
You have a helluva way of answering.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
I don't give tours.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Gaiijin?
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
There was a change in plans.
Ich said you left.
He gets as much as he wants.
Don't give him any more.
Then take it from him.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
Don't be.
I'm amused.
This is my stop.
Time, I've got plenty of.
She's such a long way home for you.
Guess I'm on a roll.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
I'm taking you back.
Keep the change.
Right.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
He killed a police officer.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
He was my partner.
It's not your job.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Why me?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
What...?  What if I say no?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
What?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Why?
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Yeah.
One guy do all the damage?
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
Not in that company.
Dope?
This by this...
How big a package we talking about?
Goodbye, officer.
I have to get to Sugai.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
You had my help, detective.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Look.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
What's this?
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Because I want you to tell me.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Could you fill me in?
Do you know what this is?
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
You're foreigners.
We're police officers.
It is not allowed.
I want a gun.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
You want him dead too.
That wasn't our deal.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
Good.
I don't have to.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
If I say no?
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
With these?
I'll pay you.
You trust me?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Why tell me this?
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
The families who control the casinos?
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
He'll be dealt with.
I want him.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
