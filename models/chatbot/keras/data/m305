Cut that backsass!
But I made this arrangement --
Git movin', I said.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Git your shovel and git to work.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
I got two years.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Buck is a deal.
I'll make it a dollar.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
We work down in the ditch?
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
That's good: he earned it.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Yeah.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
She took off with that convertible feller...
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
No.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
What went wrong?
Here, Mom.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
What are you doin' here?
Yeah.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
How'd you find me?
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
We saw the broads.
He's probably a gigolo.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
You steal a car?
Tell us about it.
Ram it in and break it off!
Go hard!
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Gotta have kings.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Lookit her bounce.
Yes, Boss.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Go git it, Luke.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
You got your mind right, Luke?
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
Git to work!
Please! Please!
I... I... I...
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You don't know!
I don't know, Boss.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Comin' out here, Boss?
She's got him! You hear that?
Here's the Patrol.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Here, Captain.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
Borrowin'.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
You jes' watch us!
You can't do that!
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
Hey, Tattoo!
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
I'll give you fifty cents.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
He's gonna be awright.
That's my baby.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
A cold drink? Okay?
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
A cold drink.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
What for?
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Get away!
Lemme see it!
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
What happened? How far did you get?
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
'Bout two hours left.
But there's still daylight left.
I call.
So then you just call him.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
Pair'a nines.
Whatcha got?
Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Tramp! Beautiful!
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Thass right. Just play it...
Like I always do?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
On my own.
Luke. Where you goin?
Take it easy, Drag.
But, Luke...
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
What you mean, Luke?
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
Like an elephant.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
We got it locked in the sock.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
That's it. That's the end.
Where'd the road go?
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Cool Hand Luke.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Innocent?
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
You tryin' to say somethin'?
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
I just always did like truck rides.
Whatta you so happy about?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
A Lucas Jackson.
Well, whatta we got here?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Somebody say somethin'?
Oh mah baby Luke.
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh Lord!
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh my. Oh my... Give it back here!
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
What's the writing say?
Forty-five.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
You just said he could eat anything.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Cuter.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Call.
Cuter again.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
I'm in.
Cuter.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Man, it's so hot.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
No more than five. For a cold drink.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
But -- but --
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
Well, how far didya get?
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
Damn.
Kick a buck.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Man Oh Man.
You phony creep!
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
No. No chains either.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
What are you talking about?
He'll never make it.
Oh for...
How about you tryin' to make me?
Stop that.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
One, two, three... 
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
