They think you did it.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Give her some cigarettes.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Ja, ja, ja.
Den leuten.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Ich weiss nicht.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
...anyway?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
...quarrel?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Why are you lying?
Oh, well.
His.
That's his headache.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Oh, the usual things...
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
I saw him today.
How do you know?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
I shall be all right.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
I'm sorry.
Harry.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
...Headquarters.
How did you know I would be here?
...is there?
Oh...
Are you going, too?
There isn't enough for two laughs.
...again.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
I'll put these flowers in water.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
He liked to laugh.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
He told you, didn't he?
...you know.
Have you?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Have you seen Calloway?
A parrot...Let it go.
What happened to your hand?
Why?
I'm going back home.
I don't know.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Me.
Wer ist da?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I wish I knew.
What are you going to do?
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
Wait here.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
What's the matter?
Let's go away.
Yes.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
It's all right.
I'm so sorry.
Holly.
We're both in it, Harry.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
I thought you wanted...
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
It's just what he used to say.
Seemed like a good idea.
Anna.
...and buried him.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Tell me more.
Oh, that was many years ago.
Where is she?
...to steal my girl.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
When...what did you do?
Tell you what?
Tell me about him.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
H-E-Z-T...
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
What's that?
Gestern bein heurigen...
Well you read this.
Do I...
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
In German?
Can I hear you?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Need we go through it all again?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Silly looking bunch.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Who are you looking for now?
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Harry?
Whiskey.
Drink?
Dr. Winkel.
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Why?
They're forged.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
What's she talking about?
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
I was told there were only two men there.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
...at all.
Mmmm.
He was Harry's driver?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Were you at the inquest?
Yes.
His own doctor?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Dr. Winkel told me that.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Oh, yes, yes.
He has a little dog.
No.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
Do you understand German?
You were awfully good.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
Nichts danke. Kein.
Keep the packet.
Thank you.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Of course.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
I don't know.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
That's what we want to find out.
Where's Harry?
I said another man was buried in his place.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
It's true then?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Two weeks ago.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
You can help us.
It wasn't important.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
No.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
Joseph Harbin...
I have never seen him.
Do you know this man?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
And my passport?
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
There's nothing in them.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
That's the reason.
They're Harry's.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Yes.
...parents.
Good-bye.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
I don't...
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
I don't want it.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
They are - private - letters.
They'll be returned, miss.
Must you take those?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
How will I know you?
Just around the corner.
Where?
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Yes.
Can I have that woman's passport?
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Thank you.
Yes, of course.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
No, not yet.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
This is forgery. It is very clever.
What is it?
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Be sensible, Martins.
One can't just leave - please.
Well, there's not much time.
Wait a minute - let me out.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Two thirty.
What time is it?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Win what?
I said you win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
All right, Calloway. You win.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
Of course.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
You all did.
Didn't I?
She's right. It's none of my business.
A girl of spirit.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
Calloway!
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
It wouldn't work.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
How about the doorway?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
Which side of the road?
Fifty yards right down there.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
No.
I suppose you don't believe me.
I see.
This is where he vanished.
Well?...
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Thank you. Excuse me.
...in the morning.
I'm not asking you to.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
...a week ago.
I can't. He disappeared...
Bring him in.
So would I.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Next, Paine.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Do you see what that means?
In Vienna...
Well?
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
A parrot bit me.
A bruised lip.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Get the next plane.
You're not locking her up?
Miss Schmidt.
Calloway.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Getting around, Martins.
What the devil?
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
...expense.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Listen, Callaghan.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
It wasn't petrol.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Pin it on a...
Ever seen one?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
He was...
What are you trying to say?
...to him.
Best thing that ever happened...
Him dying like that.
What?
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
No.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
I can't say that I have.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
No, sorry.
Holly Martins.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Once in a while.
See much of him before that?
September '39.
When did you see him last?
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Schmolka!
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
No.
Been here long?
Yes.
You a friend of Lime's?
Martins.
My name is Calloway.
Fellow called Lime.
Can you tell me whose...
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Shall I go over there, sir?
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
...of Santa Fe."
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Very good, sir.
This way, miss.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
It's a military hotel.
Take him to Sacher's.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I'll look it up for you.
...his number.
No, I don't know...
Do you know his number?
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
...excuse me.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Zane Grey.
Of course, of course, of course.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
What's that?
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
What about?
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Seems exciting.
Certainly.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
Goodness, that's awkward.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
Heard of Harry Lime?
No, a major, were you really?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
I know a very good dentist.
Come upstairs a moment.
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
They wouldn't know me.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Welcome?
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
You do!
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Very popular, sir.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Striptease, sir.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Never heard of him.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Who?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Crabbin.
What do you want?
...this way.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Sure...
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
You told them, didn't you?
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
As long as they can use you?
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
You've got plenty of contacts.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Why not?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
You can get somebody else...
What do you want me to do?
You wouldn't do anything.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Did the police believe you?
And - Anna...
Unwise, Holly...
I told the police.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Holly...
You can help her.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
She's been arrested.
Hmm.
It's good to see you, Holly.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
I want to talk to you.
Yes.
Listen...
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Hello, Harry.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Are you mad?
How do you do.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
The Roumanian?
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
But you will.
Not yet.
What's the name of this girl?
...the best way one can, you know.
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
...your address?
Will you give me...
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
...you.
A Roumanian.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
But he said he died instantaneously.
...you know and all that.
What did he say?
...were of you.
Here?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
At the end of every chapter --
You really liked it?
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
Zwei zwartze.
Coffee.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Not necessarily.
In great pain?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
I understand...
Could he have been at all conscious?
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Hear the details.
Find out?
I have guests waiting.
Thank you.
Coming to the point, please.
Martins.
Yes.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Vinkel.
Dr. Winkel?
I am not a bad man.
Yes, it is.
Well make it your business.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
Now, hold on.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Suppose I take...
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
You don't mean that doctor?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
And?
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
Kurtz.
Who else?
...give evidence.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
I was told that he did not die at once.
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Could he have been conscious?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
You saw it?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
What's he saying?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
What does he say?
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
...Popescu...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Mr. Lime - yes.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Yes, sir.
Excuse me!
Must be some mistake.
Baron Kurtz.
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Coffin?
Who?
Already gone.
English?
Speak English?
Never.
...Mr. Martins?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Should I make it all fact?
Yes.
...this time.
Not when I get interested.
Mr. Martins...
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Third Man.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Joseph Harbin.
No.
Not necessarily.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
What else did he tell you?
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
He didn't want to get involved.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else?
That's all you meant?
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Something wrong.
Funny?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Harry...
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Oh, you did.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Okay.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
His name?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Where are you staying?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Oh.
Passport, please.
