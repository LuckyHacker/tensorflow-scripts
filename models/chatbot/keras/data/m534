Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Oh, yeah?
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
You heard me: leave the table!
What?
Out! Leave the table!
He isn't.
What if he is?
Don't ever say that.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Thanks, Scoob.
No prob. I'm cool.
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
Oh.
You know...Stanley...
Like what?
There are some rumors...
What?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Hey. What's up?
Hey.
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Marty, ignore him.
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Great to be here.
Nice to have you here.
Thank you.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
I'll be your guest!
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
For rape and murder.
Why was he on Death Row?
I know!
But really, you never know.
I am sure.
But still, you can't be sure.
He wasn't.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Jesus was not bad.
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Poison gas.
How did they execute him?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
Oh. How did it happen?
He's dead.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
My grandchild-baby.
You have a bay?
My baby.
Who is Jesus?
My Jesus
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Speak English.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
No.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
This is work.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
I'm always working.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
No, Mikey.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
I'm still poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
We had to work. My family was poor.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
I did not go to high school.
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
No.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
It was God's will.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Really? How many?
Yes.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes, Mikey?
Consuelo?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
What's an audience going to tell you?
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
We're not ready!
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
We're not ready.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Nothing, I guess
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
This is definitely better.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
The camerawork's nice.
Yes, I do. I love them!
No, you don't.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
So whaddya think?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
What?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Yes, Mikey?
Mom?
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Twinkeys!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Don't even joke about that!
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Sure!...
He's right.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
It's all about who you know.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
We used pull.
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Marty...
Got a lot of homework?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
What's tomorrow?
Ready for tomorrow?
Fine.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
How was the class?
We did the same thing last year also.
I dunno.
What are you going to do?
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
Is everything OK?
Was anyone in my room today?
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Your story was terrible!
You know he hated my story also.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What do you want?
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
You mean, again?
I can read it to you.
Huh?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
But what kind of pull did you have?
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Reconceive.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Tired of this shit...
OK.
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
Whaddya wanna talk about?
We have to talk.
Yeah?
Scooby?
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Get the hell outta here!
Just the same.
The same. Same as what?
The same.
So? How was school today?
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
What DO you know?
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
I dunno.
I'm going in there.
Fuck!
Sure, Dad.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Gee, you're home early!
Come here, give me a hug!
Hi, Dad!
Hey, Mikey!
OK!
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Thanks.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
One in a million recover.
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Again!!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
'Fuck me hard!'
Nigger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
...gger.
...gger.
Ni...
Say, Ni...
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Take off your top.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Thanks.
It's over there.
Thank you for being honest.
No.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Maybe. She's OK.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
You have beautiful skin.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
That's good.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
You're not.
Can I join you?
Uh huh.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Well, now you have.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Hello, Vi.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
I dunno...
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
OK.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
I hate reading.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
No.
Any books you like to read for fun?
No, not really.
Maybe she has caller ID.
OK. Bye.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
Eight, six, and four.
Great. How old are they?
Three.
How many?
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
That's good.
Hunh.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
I do.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
That's too bad.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Anything I might know about?
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
I believe it.
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
But...you called.
That's what I was gonna ask you.
So what's going on?
Great!
Great!
Oh, fine. How are you?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Toby Oxman.
Who is this?
Hello, is this Pam?
Hello?
No, thanks.
You want some?
I mean...
Yeah. I know.
You know...I like you.
Yeah?
Scooby?
You should be.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
No, I don't think so...
Is it loaded?
I know.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
How'd you get it?
Thanks.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Oh.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
He did?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
What is most important to you?
Thanks man.
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Can I see what you have so far?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Prnceton.
So where'd you get in?
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Whoopee.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Doubt it.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
What for?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
You a pervert?
