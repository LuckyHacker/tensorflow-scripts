You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
Adelle?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Hello?
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
No...
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
So you left her?  Just like that?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Excuse me?
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
You?  Married?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Her assistant?
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Kate Reynolds...
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Oh, and Oxxford called...
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
No.
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
But I think I like you better this way...
Excuse me?
Its not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. Were not sure which one, Julias on it right now. Word is theyre willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we shouldve been prepared for this.  Were in trouble here, Jack...
Whats going on here?
Jack, are you okay?
Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
I dont think youre hearing me.
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
Seven.  Really.
...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
What about me?
Take you, for instance...
Im sure you do...
And I know people.
Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people...
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Thats right. And auto supply...
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
You have kids, Jack?
I can see that, Alan.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Mr. Mintz.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Why Jack?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I don't know.  Maybe...
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Is that tonight?
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Thats right.  Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Were almost done here...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Rise...and...shine...!
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Is it morning yet?
Ringing my bell...
What are you doing?
Ah. A classic...
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Very nice. What is it?
Right.  Thats a major oversight...  So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia...
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Mom liked it.
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Like what?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Thats where you work.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Big Eds.
Where do I go now?
Bye...
Got it.  Good tip.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Five thirty.  Okay.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Check...
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
Sure.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
I think I could figure it out.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
On a case by case basis...
Do you like kids?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Who did?
They did a pretty good job.
I dont know...
Wheres my real dad?
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
I never won anything in bowling.
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Howd you know my name?
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Its me, Jack...
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...
Hey, is that really necessary?
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
So could you write down her exact address?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Pretty much.
She said that?
She wants to have an affair with me.
She is relentless.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Youre right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
Damn...
Its just two kids, right?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Kates my wife...
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Its not Kate, is it?
I dont think so.
Trouble at work?
Is it...?
What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Im having kind of a bad day.
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
Were friends, arent we?
Great room...
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
Cmon Jack...
Ive got all the time in the world...
Got a minute, Jack?
The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
Ive got kids, Im going home...
Cmon, Jack...
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Look Jack Im late.  Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
But what do I do?
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Why not?
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
How much time?!
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Give me my goddamn life back!
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
What the hell is happening to me?!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Basically, its my car now.  Get in.
What?!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
Miss me, Jack?
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
I've got everything I need.
You just said everyone needs something.
Me?
Yeah?  What do you need?
Everyone needs something.
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Hey...
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
A lucky streak, huh?
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
I call all you white guys "Jack."
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Damn, you are the real thing...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Yes you do...
No.
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Get out!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Get out, I call 911.
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
What're you talkin' about?
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
It would help me if we were.
Are we finally being honest?
Is there something going on between us?
Are we what, Jack?
Are we...?
Youre a nurse?
Need a nurse?
Something like that.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Evelyn, right?
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Cmon, as soon as I put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
I dont think so, thank you...
Finger food...?
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
Its lovely...
Like the dress...?
Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Thanks.  To you too...
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Okay, chief.
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
You want me to handle him?  I think Im ready...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Uh huh...
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
No, I didnt...thats great.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Thank you.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Uh-huh...
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Jack.
Dont get on that plane!
Jesus, Jack...
You cant go!
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Youre not married, are you?
Not with what they pay me...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Thats the one...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
Youre moving...
Paris?
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Whats going on?
Dont worry about it, Jack...
I'm sorry...
Its good to see you...
You look great.
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
Kate...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Promise me again...
I promise, Jack...
Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that.
Are you okay, Jack?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Dont do that...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
Jack.
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Annie goes to a great school.
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
A perk for what?
This place is a perk, Kate.
For the week?
Think bigger.
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Its like a museum.
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
I could stay here forever...
Thats all I wanted to hear...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Youre so...beautiful...
Way out...
Im out of the doghouse?
I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
What are you sure about?
Good things...
Its wonderful...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
Thats a big one for me, too.
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
But you always seem so certain.
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
Now...I dont...
And now...?
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
Worse, you mean...
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
Are you sure?
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
I think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse.
Okay...
I need to tell you something.
But Im gettin close, right?
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
How do you even know about this place?
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Jack...can we afford all this?
Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
I know that, but...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
You really are incredible...
Zeena...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
No, open it...
Maybe I should wait...
Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
Jack.
What? You make me hot...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Not it...?
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
What...?
Say it, Jack...
Its good, right?
Thank you...
I want it...
You want the cake!?
Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
Cmon.
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
You mean this chocolate cake?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
How was the game, honey?
How would you look at it?
If you want to look at it that way...
Our life in a nutshell...
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
You had a heart attack?
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Well...Annie for one.
Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
Really.
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Excuse me?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
No?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
She got those shoes...
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Do what?
How can you do that?
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
Thanks, Jack...
Whatever you say...honey.
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
That is the general idea, yes...
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
Im working on a new deal now...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Hey!  I was watching that!
Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
And...?
Uh...that babys crying...
HEY!
...my feet are hurtin...
Hello!
Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...
But its twenty degrees outside...
Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
No, shes not.
Shes your dog, Jack.
Youre kidding me...
Here you go...
Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
Jack...
Uh huh...
Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Because youll be here.
Why not?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
What are you doing?
Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Jack...dont even start...
Because thats where I live.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
I was in the city.
Where were you?
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
What kind of man does that!?
Yeah...fine.
Are you okay?
You hear me complaining about that?
I can't seem to let go of you...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
What?
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
For us, Kate.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Dont  go, Jack...
I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
I have a bad feeling about this.
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
All in one tape?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
No...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Mrs. Peterson.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
Do I know you?
Peter Lassiter...
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Not by a long shot.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Aspen.
Where is he?
I need you, tiger..
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
And God love you for it.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Im sorry, no...
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Is there anything I can do for you?
No...Im not...
Hey, are you okay?
Damn...damn...damn...
Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Can I help you?
You wont regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Okay, Ill take them...
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Christmas?  It cant be Christmas...
Merry Christmas...
Thats totally see through...
If it's something you feel strongly about.
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
I'm taking the train...
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
So we'll get egg nog.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Tonight.
I'd like that, too.
I want to see you again.
Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
Last night was great...
Of course I did.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I found it!
Yes!
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...
You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
