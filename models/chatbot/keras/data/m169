That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Gabriel!
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
He'll be dead when he does.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
I've been doing good, though.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
-- till he fucked his parole --
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Searching for a money man...
To all those cons...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
...whoever she is.
He wants... your "sister"...
No, baby. He wants me.
He wants the money.
We're talking, aren't we?
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
NO!
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
You promised me!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
Gabriel, you promised!
YES!!!
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Don't hurt him...
Is this him!?
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
A man of some travels.
Gabriel!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
What are you doing here?!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Gabriel, let him go --
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel -- !
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Thank you.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
We sell children's toys --
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Toys for... adults?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
You can't find... what?
I never told you my name.
You said it a million times!
But I never said Rudy.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
No --
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
What are you talking about?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
What?
Merry Christmas.
I'm glad it was me.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who wouldn't.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You shouldn't have.
I saved your life.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You... you... YOU --
Yeah. That's love.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
Well. I'm going home.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
They all are. Football's on.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
No.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
He says he wants it now.
I'm almost done.
He wants to see your map.
Part of... with them?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Nick, what are you talking about?
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
We'll need one.
I don't know...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
What?
They'll have guns.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
I love you, Nick...
Don't say my name...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
You saved me.
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
Nick, the ice is --
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
Nick, what happened --
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
That guy knows you?
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
So does it look a lot different?
Get your own room.
Nick...
Get your own room, Ashley.
We? What "we"...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
They're truck drivers.
They've never done a robbery?
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
What?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
He working for them on this one?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
Not without you.
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
No!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
I thought we'd have a few more days.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
Jack. Jack Bangs.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
Canada.
Gabriel!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
...maybe I die for Nick...
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Nick died for me....
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Your pen palls dead, lady.
I love you!
You're in on this.
No, Nick, no --
You told him about Nick's letters.
Nick, please, it's me --
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
You're not hearing me here --
He'll kill you.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Get the hell off of me!
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, I love you --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Nick, what are you --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick --
You sold him out.
Nick, no --
You motherfucker.
What's going ON!!!
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
What the fuck is going on.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
...the truck driver...
Your brother...
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
Nick...
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
NICK!
NO!
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
I'll see what I can do.
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
We could live it up and --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Well, I don't know about that --
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
Beauty and fragrances.
You forget where I work?
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You need a COAT!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Ashley, Jesus --
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Where the hell are you going?
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Yes it was all you --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Tell me again.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
No, c'mon --
One more. Smile. One more.
No --
Smile.
What.
Do that again.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
You are to me.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Saw me --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No, no --
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Radio said.
I don't think it's negative five.
Yeah.
Negative five?
Radio said negative five.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
How'd you know my name.
Ash?
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Ash?
How'd you know my name...
Get in the CAR!
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
'Tis the season, convict.
You gotta be kidding me.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
No gun.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
No, you're not.
I'm no threat without a gun.
No way.
Six men means six guns.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
No.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
NO.
You need six.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
What's the code?
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
Sing it in pictures, Nick.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Start singing.
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
No, Gabriel... no...
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
NO!
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nnn... nothing...
What'd you tell that casino manager?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
...never... tried...
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
Don't tip.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
I'm gonna need some money.
You got one hour.
Get out.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Do I get a country-western name?
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
At least gimme video poker.
You do.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Put it on.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
Might as well be.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
More than you know.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Why not.
They won't recognize me.
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
So what the hell good are you...
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
And I worked there. For a year.
We walked the place for a week.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
What the fuck are you talking about.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
I did.
I said, who the hell made the map?
What?
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
Hell. Ten?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
Hey, it's... been two years --
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
Christmas... Eve...
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Five million?
The hell you don't.
I don't know.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Hey.
You knew the place --
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
No. It's her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Her brother.
What's her greatest fear?
A station wagon in Canada.
Be more specific.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
What college.
What'd they call her in college?
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in high school?
Samantha.
What's her middle name?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What?
Where's she work?
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
I had better sex in prison.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
Wish I had a brother like you.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
She says a lot of things.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
I never worked at no casino.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Yes!
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
But you were saying you were...
I shared his cell!
You're not Nick Mason...
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
You what...
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Put him in the truck.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Who are you now.
The hell I can't.
No, you can't --
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
You... you don't know me --
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Where the HELL did he go?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
And where they hide the real money.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Leave the tree.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Take 'em.
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
GO!!!
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
OPEN IT!!!
I can't go back to Vegas...
He's not Nick Mason...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
...so where is he?
I don't steal any --
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
What... Powwow...
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I don't know... what you're...
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
Show's over.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Mr. Bangs.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
We're aware of your position.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
What?
What about the Powwow Safe?
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
The Powwow Safe?
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
That motherfucker --
Acid-chewer.
Cancer-sucker.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
My what?!
How long ago was your makeover?
Five years. Since it opened.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Fuckin' freezing.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
I promise you, I didn't know!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Merlin, I didn't know --
You knew there were guns in here!
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Where the hell's Gabriel?
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
What about the money?
How do we do that?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we take them out?
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
What the hell was that about --
Not with you.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
You want that for here or to go?
Hi, Nick.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
Fuckin, Zookerman --
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Oh, man --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
It's a roach, guy --
Monsters in the gelatin...
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
You gave them me.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Do what?
How'd you know I'd do it.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
And you set me up.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
She set them up. All of them.
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
NICK!!!
...for Christmas...
NO!!!
...be with her...
YOU TELL HER!
Tell Ashley... I...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
No, man! No, no, no!
Ash... Ashley...
GUARD!!!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Jesus, Rudy --
GUARD!!!
Alamo...
GUARD! GUARD!
Standing right here, man!
Don't move, Rudy!
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Rudy, don't move --
Good for you. Protein.
Just a roach, Zook.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
What, working security?
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Aw, Rudy.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Thought you hate your old man.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Oh.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
She's using a new perfume.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
I'm just talking.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
I'm just saying.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
And some pecan pie.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
What?
Hot chocolate.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Not yet.
Three days, man.
Ain't there yet.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Hell you haven't.
Haven't thought about it.
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
There is no other table --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I'm ninety-two years old --
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
What? No...
Switch seats with me.
You're hitting for MY cards!
But... I had a five...
POP! That was My card!
Well...sorry...
That was my king!
I... sorry, Mister...
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Without having them hit the alarms.
They changed the layout.
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Since when? What the hell is this room?
That's what it looks like!
Who the hell made this map.
Start talkin
I'M NOT NICK!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
