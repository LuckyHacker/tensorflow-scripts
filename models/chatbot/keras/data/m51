I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I gotta work with these women.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Loretta, don't do that.
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
Airport Ho-Jo!
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
This came for you, sweetie.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Okay.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Really?
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
What is wrong with you?
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Thank God for bunge cords.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Loretta, never have kids.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
My mom wanted me to have this?
You-betcha.
Really, Loretta?
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh-yah.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Yeah, you betcha...
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
So, what do I say?
Oh God, I'm dead...
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
You're what?!
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
She's right over there.
Where is she?!
She's alive, sweetie.
Is Mom okay?
Oh-you-beccha.
Yah?
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Your parents'd kill you.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Amber? Here.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Oh, Amber...
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Huh?
Mrs. Leeman?
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
I'm gonna need more caps.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Amber...
-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
It's okay.
We was robbed.
Bye mom.
I love you much.
C'mere. I love you so much.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
That's it, I'm goin'...
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Ow!
What?!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Mom!
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Go on! Get out!
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh shit!
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
This, this... This is bullshit!
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
We all do. Now let's go.
I hate her!
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Bitch!
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
I just did.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
You heard me. Where is it?
What?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
What're you doin' here?
Yes, Leslie!
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Yes...
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yeah...
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Here, have some.
Here, I didn't get any.
Bye.
Okay... well, bye.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
I know.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Hi.
Hi...
They told me to practice.
Annette, just use your hand.
Okay. Take her purse.
We was robbed.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Anyone?
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
So? Be real easy.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
I got a hairdo.
You don't know where this is gonna...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Loretta, shut it.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
This here's Loretta.
Oh, naw. Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Hi.
Hi.
You could be quiet.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
My dress'll reek.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
The important thing is that we have a winner...
The bitch.
All right, then.
Wisconsin.
What?
That bitch from...
Ohio...
Dakota.
Yeah.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Mm-hm.
Okay?
That's right.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
I'm a mirror.
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
And the year before that?
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Yeah.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Tammy Curry?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
That's enough!
Becky was my only shot at state!
So help me, Gladys.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Gladys! Stop it!
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Lester?
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Enid ate a whole pan!
This is -- what?
We need more bars!
What!
Uh, Gladys?
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Yeah.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Oh! What is it?
All right, let's go.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
Nothin' too showy!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Close up shop!
Harold!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
