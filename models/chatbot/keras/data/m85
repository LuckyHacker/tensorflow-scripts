Time to play.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
We have no more surprises.
We've always been here.
It's different for us.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Oh, I do. I do.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
You knew?
I knew you'd come.
Frank.
Julia.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
He... he loved me.
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
Yes!
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
I knew you'd come back.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
I want to go back!
It certainly is.
It's coming.
She certainly has.
She's done it.
I know.
It's a beautiful dress...
No. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Yes... Yes. You look...
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
Kyle, you don't have...
O.K. Let's go.
Because I'm going to get my father!
WHY?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Are you crazy?
Get out of the way.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
The boxes! I TOLD you.
What do you mean?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The box. I need the box.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
And you're sure it was a woman?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
So you slept O.K.?
No bad dreams.
If anyone can help, HE can.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
What?
I... I had a visitor.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
God, that's terrible.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
What's the matter with her?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
You a doctor, too?
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
It's been Hell.
Well... G'bye.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
I'm scared.
Finish what?
I've got to finish it.
What are you talking...
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
You were ALL human!
I... remember.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Nonsense, I...
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
Wait!
And what about you?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
I've come for my father!
Then why are you here?
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
The Cenobites.
Who?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Yeah.
He talked about Demons, huh?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Oh, excuse me...
What are you talking about? Who are you?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Steve...
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Where am I?
