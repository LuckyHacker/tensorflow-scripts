Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
Occasionally.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
It's terrific Win.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Looks a little constipated to me.
You didn't like him?
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Hello, Win.
Claire!
You take care.
Say goodbye, Mike.
I do.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I like your coat.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
You don't have to, now.
I don't know...
You still going away?
So.
So.
Yeah.  It's all over.
Everyone's all right...?
Mike...?
Claire!
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
... Mike.
Yeah...
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
"To"... Forget about you.
"For"...?
Long enough.
How long you going away for?
... Don't explain.
I'd miss my life...
I know.
It wouldn't work.
I know.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Yeah.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Let's do it.
Pretty bad.
Do you?
Do you dance?
What a memory.
I'll think about Wednesday.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Claire...
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
When can I see you?
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Where?
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Oh that thing in Queens.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Are you okay?
Oh God, that's great!
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
You don't want to know.
I don't know.
What do you want to do?
Not exactly.
You told her?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
I don't know you...
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
They called here after you left...
Yeah.
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
I do care about you!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Stop being nuts!
Let go!
Stop, will you?!
Claire...!
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Claire, will you calm down?
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
You put me life in danger.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
I can't open it.
Open the door, will you?
What do you want?
Claire?
Sleep good.
Good night, Mike.
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I'll miss you, Mike...
You could do better.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
You asked.
Tell it like it is.
What's to like?
You don't like him, do you?
What about Neil?
Very nice.
But "nice".
No dog.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
No dog.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
Yeah.
And "is"...?
Yeah.  It was.
So it was "love".
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Absolutely.  Look at this.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Could be, I guess.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
No kidding.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
They're kind of fuzzy.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
How did you know?
You were reading my Renoir.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Yeah, what a woman.
Urdu and Hindi.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Hmm...
Claire?
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Big talk... Desperate guy.
He said he'd kill me.
Sooner, the better.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
Listen, that was my fault.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Yeah.
You all right?
I came on at 8:00.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
I'll come with you.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Let's get a drink.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Not too sure about that.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
I got money.
Put it on my account, please.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Beg pardon?
Would you pick one out, please?
No, Ma'am.
Are you nervous?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
Queens... You know Queens?
You live in Manhattan?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
What did he say?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
There's a phone in the car.
I'm supposed to call in.
Can we go then?
Right.  That's true.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Uh...
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Hi.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Straight ahead.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Not if you don't want me to.
You're planning to speak?
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Claire...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
And I'm making mine.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Claire...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... I don't want to talk about it...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
I'm all right.
Tommy...!
Absolutely.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
I don't know Tommy.
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Sure we are, let's go!
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
Nothing.
Keep what handy?
Me neither.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
I'm all right.
Ellie...
No.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
What about Tommy?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
Let me drive...
What's the difference?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
You talked to his wife?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What did you watch?
I watched TV.
What did you do tonight?
I'm not saying it's your fault.
I'm sorry.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
What're you talking about --
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You heard me.
What was that?
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Did you hear what I said?!!
Did you hear what I said?
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
Mike, take it easy...
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
What?
I'll be right up.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Coming to bed?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Why?
She bought it.
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
She took you shopping for a tie?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What did she say the down payment was?
It's not your taste.
Bought it.
Where'd you get the tie?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
I might stop you.
I'd identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Why?
She's got to identify him.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Honey.  You got him.
You don't want to hear about it.
What shit, honey?
Oh, some shit.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Okay?
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Hey.  The neighbors.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
I can still use a gun.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
For how long?
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
So how'd it go?
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
You got no idea...
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Get in bed.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What are you talking about?
My ass is falling.  It is.
Your what...?
My ass if falling.
What?
Mike?
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Too kinky.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
It should've been me...
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
I heard.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
What about when she identifies him?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Even Joey Venza?!
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
What about when she goes out?
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
I just sat and listened.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
No, I need'm now!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Call a cruiser!
At my house...!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Wasn't your fault.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
Not Koontz.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
You in this with me?
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Who's Joey Venza?
Right behind you, T.J.
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
... Hard?
Does it make you... hard?
Yes.
Ever shot anyone?
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
You're here 'til what time?
I don't really see what that has to do with...
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
No, I will not step outside.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Is she injured?
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I asked for the man in charge...
No, sir...
Are you in charge here?
What the fuck you doin'?!
Watch your step!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Under the table.
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Let my kid go.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Why should she come in?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
How do I know that's her?
I'll prove it!
Hold it...!
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
You should'a brought the girl.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Take care, pal.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Shooting?
Shooting.
So, what are you doing tonight?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
You coming in?
We're gonna pass the street.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
She's what?
She's taking singing lessons.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
Mom and I got plans.
How about dinner tonight?
Okay, I guess.
How are things going, pal?
Yeah, I think so.
Nice threads Dad.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Lay back, Mack.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
I know where everything is.
How do you know where the gun is?
Scrambled eggs surprise?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
What're we having?
