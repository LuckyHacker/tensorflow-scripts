It's time for tea, Grandma.
Yes, I did.
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Can I make sandwiches...?
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
But you always let me....
Come on, sweetheart....
Watch me, Grandma....
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Don't bother Hoagie....
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Thea....
That's what grandmas are for.
You'll spoil her.
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
I don't know....
Where's my mother?
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
Where is she?
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Sweetheart....
It went away....
You knew...?
But it went away...We would have known....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Where have you been...?
They're at the beach....
Close the door.
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
I have work....
Off....
No....
Turn it off....
Then don't come any closer.
No fair, I'm not armed.
I don't know...You...I don't know.
What the hell are we arguing about?
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
Because....
How come it's my responsibility?
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Tell Matt he should be here....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
I'll be right there.
We need beer....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
We need milk....
Make a list.
We forgot to stop at the store.
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
It sure is....
It sure is good to be home....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
Like mother, like son....
Chicken....
No way....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Nowhere....
Where are you going?
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
He was doing his job....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
He told me you both did....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
You make sure they come?
We'll be there....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Whatever happens next.....
Beginning of what?
It's beginning....
All he did was kiss me....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
I'd be afraid of losing....
You want to try your hand at something...?
You're not interfering, Ellen....
You caught me....
Henny Youngman....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
I can't help it....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
I like it.  Really....
It'll grow on you.
I'm not on vacation....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
He knows what he has to do....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
They won't kill it....
We're going down.  All of us....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
What difference does it make?  It's here....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
You have something to say about everything....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Spent it all on beer....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Michael!
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Michael!  This thing working?
I won't....
Don't be late.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
A big one....
Good.
He heard that.
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
I'm on the phone....
You check it....
The fish.  Check it....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
We don't want any....
Adds flavor....
Are you all right?
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
I'm hungry, Mom....
I see what you're doing....
Can't help myself....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
That hurt....
I'm not doing anything.
That....
Stop what?
Stop that....
I'll miss you....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Good night, Daddy....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Thanks for the consultation....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I didn't.
I almost forgot....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
It's not nice to be evasive.
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
Who's coming?
You're coming, aren't you...?
You're silly....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I'm still five....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
Mommy lets me....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
I like Grandma's cooking....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
I never....
It's too dangerous....
Can I ride one sometime...?
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
You can stay in my room.
Yes!
What's going on?
In a minute....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
Promise me....
Promise me you'll be all right....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Why'd you take the boat?
Why'd you come out here?
It got him....
No.
You hungry?
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I don't want to talk about that.
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I have to get this finished.
You and Sean used to make....
I'm fine....
You look tired....
Trying to write our report....
It's late....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
You just got here....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
Good.
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
You're not a pain in the ass....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I enjoy his company....
I am.
You're having a good time....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
I'm not going to quit now....
You could teach...You could....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I want you to give up your work....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
Good.  So will I....
I'll be all right, Michael.
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
Okay.
How are you doing?
I'm fine....
All you all right?
You were a monkey....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
I didn't mean to start that....
Come on, I'll show you around.
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Dad died from a heart attack....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
I'm just getting started....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
What?
I want you to get out of the water....
You guys must be starving....
Sit down, Ma....
Mother....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Yes you can....
I can't....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
My vision is perfect....
You sure you don't need glasses?
The whole idea is preposterous....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I'm sorry...I....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Why?
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
Won't you get in trouble...?
I borrow it without telling him....
What?
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I like to travel....
You're always taking time off....
I could take some time off....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
That's hard to imagine....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
But it gets cold in winter....
I have my own little island.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
Good.  I have two left....
I have two right feet.
You'll be sorry.
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
No!
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
You're not going to bet it all....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
A big one....
A big one....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
You promised me a drink....
I'm terrific... Come on....
No, you're not....
I'm fine.
Nothing....
What's wrong?
It's wonderful....
How do you like flying?
The plane's turning....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
You're impossible....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
Where do I pull off...?
It's just like driving a car....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
What are you doing?
No one does till they learn....
I don't know how....
Sure you can....
I can't....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Doesn't matter....
Depends on where you want to go....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
It was no accident....
It could have been an accident....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I always listen to my feelings....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Flies the plane....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Can you just go off...?
You must get bored easily.
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
No....
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
Yes I can....
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
Just like that?
Hurry!
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
You the architect?
You're the man who drives the plane.
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
I do....
Want to go for a little ride?
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I'll get it back next time.
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
I have coffee in the thermos.
They had them on the big one....
Aye, aye, Captain....
Keep it steady....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Get her started....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
You sure you know how to do this.
Grab your socks....
She said it was coming....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
You got a better idea...?
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
I hope she's a good sailor....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
It needs more time to charge.
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
What happened?
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Come on, Hoagie....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Can't this thing go any faster?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
What's that....?
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Good news travels fast....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
You too, Michael....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Let me speak to Ellen....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
Feathers all over the place....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Oh, boy....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
I wish there was something I could do....
She's a tough lady....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
How's Ellen?
Inch by inch....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Still tagging conch?
Still chasing fish?
Yeah....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
Matt?
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Jake.
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
It's my fault...I have to....
No way....
I'll do it, Jake.
My equipment doesn't crap out....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
It'll work....
All the time....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
I've got to get to her....
What the hell are you doing?
Mom....
Holy Christ....
Screw you, Jake....
You told me what?
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
I don't like the song.
You don't like my voice...?
Stop that!
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Shove it....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Shit....
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
'Snuck up on me....'
'A Moray eel....'
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Just trying to be helpful....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Maybe he only likes white meat....
How come only me?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
You getting a reading on them?
She's not going to like it....
I'm going down, Jake....
What about Carla's gig?
I didn't ask you to....
I don't like it....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I'm coming...How close is it?
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
Maybe it's gone....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
We lost it....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I am...You must know something about him....
Half don't...Bring her about....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
What's so funny about that?
What do you know about him?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Hoagie.
Who?
How long has he been here...?
Bring her to starboard.
As long as he's been here....
How long?
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long have you known Hoagie?
What?
How long have you known Hoagie?
Shit....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
So far..
And it's always worked?
Lots of times....
You sure you've done this before?
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
I don't know shit about electronics....
So did I....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
The shark will get it for us.
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
Okay...we got it together....
We got it together, Jake....
When I invited you...
When I signed on....
When I got the grant.....
When we got the grant....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Gave them the day off....
What happened to Clarence and...?
Down here....
Where is everybody?
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Holy shit!
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
Spade's a garden tool....
What?
I wish you wouldn't say that....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Stop busting my hump....
How many?
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
They put bombs on dolphins....
Money is money....
Forget it....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
I didn't do it on purpose....
Bad boy....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Maybe I missed you too....
Put me down, damnit....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Hey!
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
You didn't stick them on right....
I stuck them on, man....
I made them, man....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
The readings suck....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
We'll pass around cigars....
The females have eggs....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You tagging them...?
Will you leave me alone...?
How many...?
Try the area around the wreck....
Stop busting my hump....
Stop farting around....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Woman has taste....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
I'm training to....
She's in management....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
Oh, Jake... 
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
I told you....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here it comes....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
In a few minutes....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Don't flatter yourself.... 
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
I'll take care of it.
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Cow tipping?
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Where's Lenny?
Good night, Polly....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Anything to do before I go home?
