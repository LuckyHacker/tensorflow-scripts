What?
Benjamin?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
The day after tomorrow?
No.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Where did he do it?
Shhhh.
Oh no. He said that.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
No, Benjamin.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Why do you have to see him?
Yes.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Carl who?
Carl who?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
I just don't think it would...
Why wouldn't it?
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would work.
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Tomorrow?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Yes.
You really will?
I'll think about it.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I have to go back now.
We just can.
I don't see how we can.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
You mean you're confused?
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know.
When?
Yes.
Is that so? You might marry me?
I might.
But you might.
I don't know.
You won't?
Will you kiss me!
What?
Benjamin?
Goodbye.
But Elaine --
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
I don't understand.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Well -- where are you going?
No.
Are you going home?
I don't know.
What are you going to do now?
Oh.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
The marble?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
Don't you have it on?
My belt.
What are you looking for?
If you want.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Don't tell me --
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Please let me go.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Then what?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
I don't feel well.
Because it isn't true.
Why?
You've got to tell me what she said.
Let me go.
What did she say?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Did you say rape her?
I don't understand --
What?
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Elaine -- I love you.
Well, I want you to leave.
All right then! Yes!
I said I think it is.
I think it is.
What do you think?
Is it because I'm here?
Because -- I am.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Come in.
I want to ask you a question.
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
What?
Here he comes.
-- really incredible --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
But you're not enrolled.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Yes.
Here? In Berkeley?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Oh.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
No.
Is that him over there?
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
I've never been to it.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
At the Zoo.
Where are you meeting this person?
Ah. Where?
I'm meeting someone.
Get out of here.
Don't cry. 
GET OUT!
No -- don't cry --
Oh my God --
Elaine --
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
You mean the one who --
That woman. The older woman.
What?
That woman --
What is it?
Because I want to know what's happening.
Why aren't you ready?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
What's the matter?
Benjamin -- I really do.
You do?
I do.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
Yes.
You sure you really want to?
Okay.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
All right.
I'm glad.
Yes.
And it's all over now.
No.
Did they ever find out?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
With a family?
Yes.
Was she married or something?
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
Yes.
Do you?
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Of course not.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin --
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
What is the matter?
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Where we going?
All right.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Is anything wrong?
Wait a minute.
We won't. Let's go inside.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Yes, I do.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
No.
But could you try?
No, I couldn't.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
What?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
I want to go home.
I just want to tell you something.
Where is the car?
But, Elaine --
I think I'd better go home now please.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Will you take me home now?
No.
Could you do it?
I don't know.
No -- why should I?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
Why not?
No.
Aren't you eating?
I'd love some.
Do you want some dinner?
Yes.
Do you always drive like this?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Yes.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Hello.
Hello.
I certainly hope you --
Thank you.
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Is the doctor anywhere?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Hello -- who is this?
657-2036
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Yes, I will.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Exactly how do you mean?
Plastics.
Yes I am.
Are you listening?
Yes, sir.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben!
Get out!
Could I make one phone call first?
I am going to call the police now.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I want you out of here.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Because I don't like you.
What for?
You heard me. Out of here.
Mr. McCleery?
No, sir.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
What did you do to her?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
Oh -- no sir.
One of those outside agitators.
What?
You're not one of those agitators?
Ahhh.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
What are you then?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What's that?
Not exactly.
You a student?
I'll be there in an hour.
What?
Give me an hour.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Did you get a room?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Where are you?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Where are you?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Benjamin?
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Hello.
Right.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
I'd rather not.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'm putting it here by the door.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
I'm putting it on the top step.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Well I'll hand it to you.
Could you bring it up?
Well here's the purse.
I'm in the bathroom.
Mrs. Robinson?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Yes.
BENJAMIN?
Whatever you say, sir.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Of course.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Sir?
Oh no.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Where is your luggage?
What?
Where is it?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
What? No. Nothing.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Will you sign the register, please?
A single. Just for myself, please.
A single room or a double room?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Yes sir?
Ahh -- thank you.
It's in the main ballroom.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
The Singleman party, sir?
What?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
Can I help you, sir!
I don't think so.
I'll find her.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
What the hell have you done?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
What have you done to her?
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
Where is Elaine?
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Go home now.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Then you'd better start believing me.
I don't believe you.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
How?
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Mrs. Robinson --
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Now it seems to me --
Do exactly what I say.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Drive down the block.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Promise me, Benjamin.
This is absurd.
Then give me your word you won't.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
Thank you.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
May I stay then?
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
You don't have to say that.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
But if it's sickening for you --
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
But it's not.
If that's how you feel --
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
What are you doing?
Of course I wouldn't.
You wouldn't.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Of course you did.
Did I say that?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Don't start acting hurt.
What?
Now don't start this.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
You're goddamn right I am.
Are you?
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
I see.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
You're not.
Well, I'm not.
I wouldn't know.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Yes.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Benjamin?
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Let's drop it.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
No.
Then let's hear them.
I have my reasons.
But why shouldn't I?
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Do you understand that?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
There's nothing to tell.
I wish you'd tell me.
Because I don't want you to.
Why not?
No.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Don't talk about Elaine.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
That's enough.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Really. I want to know.
Oh my God.
Do you remember the make of the car?
What?
What kind of car was it?
I don't think we were the first.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
We'd go to his car.
I'm curious.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
How do you think.
Well how did it happen?
Kind of.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Art?
Art.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Why are you asking me all this?
What was your major?
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
And you were a student also.
Was he a law student at the time?
Not particularly.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
What?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Are you shocked?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Don't tell Elaine.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Well I can't.
See if you can guess.
Why did you do that?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
What?
No.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Is it?
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
I don't.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
But you don't hate him.
Not exactly.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Is it?
Man, is this interesting.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
How many times a year.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
No.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
About five years.
Well how long has this been going on.
No we don't.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
We don't.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Thank you.
Right.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Now let's keep going here.
Calm down, Benjamin.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
What?
We're talking.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Always?
He's asleep.
What do you say to him?
You walk right out the door.
I walk out.
How do you get out of the house?
There's no risk?
There isn't any.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Him?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
What?
There!
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
I don't remember.
What novel did you read.
What?
What one.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up.
Yes I do.
Do you really want me to?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Can I take off my clothes now?
I don't.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
No.
You're not interested in art?
Neither.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Go ahead then.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Don't you?
Oh.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
How about art.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Well?
Oh my God.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Anything. Anything at all.
Well what do you want to talk about?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Are you tired of it?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
If you want.
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
INADEQUATE!
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Wait a minute.
That you're afraid --
Who said it was my first time?
On your first time --
Wait a minute!
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Are you kidding?
You can admit that, can't you?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Is this -- what?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Are you afraid of me?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
This is all terribly wrong.
You what?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Okay.
Either one will be fine.
Wood or wire? They have both.
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
A hanger.
What?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Why don't you watch?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Yes?
Benjamin.
Well.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Thank you.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
What?
The number.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Yes.
To tell you?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes?
Benjamin.
Well -- goodbye then --
I'll be up in five minutes.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
That's fine.
I got a single room.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Why don't you get it.
Well -- I don't know.
Yes.
Now?
Do you want to get it now?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want me to get it?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want to?
I haven't. No.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
What?
Did you get us a room?
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Waiter!
He didn't see me.
A drink? Of course.
May I have a drink?
Very well. Thank you.
How are you?
Of course.
May I sit down?
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Hello, Benjamin.
Thank you for taking me home.
Yes.
Benjamin?
I've got to go.
Yes, I do.
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
Let me out!
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Oh my God.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Jesus Christ!
I want to say something first.
Get away from that door.
Don't be nervous.
On that chair in the hall.
Where is it?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
What?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Why is it?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
But they would! Don't you see?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
What if he did?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Yes, I have --
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Then why do you keep running away?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
What are you so scared of?
Right.
Thank you.
Come on.
I know that. But I'm --
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
I think I'll go to bed.
Will you unzip my dress?
Yes?
Benjamin?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Very much.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
No.
Yes.
Her portrait?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
What is wrong with me?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Sit down.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
It's all right.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Aren't you?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
So?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Well I don't know.
What do you think?
Like what?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
What?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What's wrong?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Pardon?
Oh my God.
My husband will be back quite late.
What?
No.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Look -- I think I should be going --
Did you know that?
What?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
What do you mean?
What do you think of me?
I'm very neurotic.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Yes.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
No.
Drink?
I don't know.
When is he coming back?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Why not?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you drink?
All right then.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Please.
But it's light in there now.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
What for?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What?
Will you come in, please?
Right.
Thank you.
Let's go.
No. 
You don't?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
That's right.
In general.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Is what a girl?
Is it a girl?
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
No.
Is there an ashtray in here?
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
How are you, Benjamin?
It's down the hall.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Goodnight, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Very good, sir.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Sir?
I say I've got it.
Hey -- I don't get it.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
No -- actually I'm not --
We haven't.
When did you two talk this over?
About an hour ago.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
No -- they don't.
They don't know?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
I do.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Goodnight.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
You don't?
No.
You believe me, don't you?
Goodnight, Benjamin.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
But I don't want you to make up something.
I do.
Not if you don't want to.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Well, wait.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
No wait. Wait.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Why did you say that?
Meet someone?
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Oh, no.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Nothing else.
What else?
I drive around.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
When I go off?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
What?
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Sure.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. She doesn't know about it.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Say that again.
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
That has nothing to do with it --
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
You got me.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
No.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Why?
Different.
To be what?
I don't know. I want it to be --
What about it?
I guess -- about my future.
About what?
Well --
-- worried?
I'm just --
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
HUH?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
You miss the point.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
That's quite a statement.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Why?
But why?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
No, I don't.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
I am not threatening you.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Now look -- please --
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
No, it's not --
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Mr. Robinson?
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Yes.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Hello.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
I will.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Great.
I will.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Oh yes.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Oh no.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
I'd like to hear it.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Thank you.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Yes, sir.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Quite a while.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
How long have we known each other now?
What?
Ben, can I say something to you?
I know.
You'll never be young again.
Sir?
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Thank you.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Thank you very much, sir.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
I've got to go.
What?
Oh no.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Yes, sir.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Swell. I appreciate it.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Yes, I can.
Can you see me now?
Can you look through the glass.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Benjamin Braddock.
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Mrs. Robinson?
Hello.
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
Dad -- can you listen --
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
I'd like to discuss this.
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
That what he says. Right?
I don't believe it.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
What's happening?
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
They are?  Come on.
The Carlsons' are here.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
Is anything wrong?
