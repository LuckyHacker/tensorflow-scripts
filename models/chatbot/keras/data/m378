All right.
I'll take you down there.
Real charmer.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
You're late.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Purpose of visit?
Go!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady!
Go!
Brady! Come with us.
Shit!
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady!
Get back!
Brady!
We're trapped in this house.
What does that mean?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
I don't know!
Is there another key?
She's not dead!
You think she stands a chance?
Look.
Not without Jamie.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Who's that?
Michael Myers.
What's going on?
We've been better.
Are you two okay?
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
No, you don't understand.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
You don't owe me anything.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
I don't know Brady.
So?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
I'm not angry it's just
Don't get angry.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
This morning.
When did you find this out?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
So?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
What?
Its about tonight.
Okay sure. What about?
We need to talk.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Yes, sir.
An accident?
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
When did this happen?
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
You guys always look great.
How do we look?
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Its too late.
Can't you find somebody else?
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Mom, please
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
I'm not calling the fire department.
We should call the fire department.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
Because the lights are all out.
How do you know their not?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
Why not?
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Found it.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
It's okay..it's okay.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
Now where are you going?
How many bodies did you find?
Four plus Myers.
How many people in the bus?
Why shouldn't I?
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
I can see this is useless.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
About what?
Why wasn't I notified?
Drive Carefully.
Night Doc.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Watch it.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Check him out.
Outside.
I do.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Has he been prepped?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Yes.
Okay, out.
Got it Earl.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
What the hell did this?
No way. No how.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Who you calling?
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
Rachel!
I've got you come on, go down.
Rachel!
Well try dammit!
I can't.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Come on.
No.
Rachel come on.
Oh Rachel!
Jamie!
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Had enough?
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Jamie, wait for me.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
I thought you said you were ready.
Coming.
Come on Rachel!
Yeah, hurry up.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
What?
It was the nightmare man
Jamie, what happened?
In a second.
Come on Rachel.
You bet.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
Hi.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Double scoops?
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
I don't want to.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
It's been eleven months.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Sure it does.
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
Like a real sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a sister?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Do you love me Rachel?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
I can't sleep.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
No.
You don't believe that do you?
Yeah.
Then we'll be safe?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
What are you doing out here alone?
All right.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
That's all the windows, Dad.
Just do it.
Why?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Dad, what's going on?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
Don't you mean what you do best?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You knew. You just didn't care.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
Hi.
Hi Rachel.
Okay, bye.
Call me.
Jamie?
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
I don't know.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
You won't come on too strong.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
You won't look pushy.
I don't want to look pushy.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Hi Jamie.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Do you?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Where are you going?
Its not over yet.
Hell of a night.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Got it Ben.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Making sure that no one can get in here.
What are we doing?
Get the outside shutters.
Go get it.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
You got your riot gun?
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
This is 132, over.
132 to 133 this is 134.
No problem, Sheriff.
You look sharp. You understand?
Right here, Ben.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
It's over.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
How's it powered?
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Where's the radio?
Be here in a minute.
Where's that Deputy?
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Evil.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
It isn't a man.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Dear God.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Yes.
Is that him? Is that him?
Least I'm not alone.
This is starting to spook me.
How do you know?
He's been here.
Something?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
When he makes that call.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Its true, Sheriff.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Why?
He's here, Sheriff.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
I am. Ben Meeker.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Sort of.
Car trouble?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Thank you.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Jamie! Get away!
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Uh huh.
Now you understand?
Okay.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
What's going on?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
