Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Lady...
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Jeremy...
What's your name?
Hey, you can't...
Take a look.
Weird shit...?
There's some weird shit here.
Yeah...?
Peter...
Shit.
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Right.
And a right.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
H-how do I get...?
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
What?
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
There's really people living down here?
New York's finest.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Go!! Just go!!
What do you-?
The kid's with them!!
The kid...
Depends.  You got a memo?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Can we get this car there?
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Is there a switch?
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
A mistake.
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
You feel anything?
Oh, Jesus!!
Its muscles are locked.
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Wait a minute-
Just do it!
I only got...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
What?
Oh, man, there you go again.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Any luck?
You got a better way up?
Oh, that's gonna work.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Did you see the size of that thing?!
20 minutes.  Susan?
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
We'll be back at the platform in...
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
No, you talkin' at me.
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
The Department of Public Health...
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Look, I showed you my badge...
Nino, please...
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
I pull.
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
What are you doing down here?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
My God, what the hell are you...?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
He's special.
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
We're no leaving you!
Across both tracks!!
Which way?
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
What?
He didn't do it!
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
But the power...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Manny...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
No...
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Just inner chambers...
We can do it!
No...
Peter...
Talk to me.
Ah...
C'mon...
I can.  We can do this...
Your arm, you can't...
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Jump in.
Oh, come on, come on!
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
Try not to sweat?
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
That's why we should do it now.
The scent won't last...
It worked before...
Peter-
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Just do it!!
What-
Rub it on the windows!
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
It's no use! They know we're in here!
How?!
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
That's camouflage...
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
Toss the flare down!
No, Jesus, no.
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Don't.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
It's me. Can you hear me?
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
It didn't bite me.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
No.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Susan, we're not b-
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
I was just late.
Oh, no, you were-
Right.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
No such thing, baby.
Great crowd.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
He was just doing his job.
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
I heard how you talked to him.
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
No, there's...
Honey, just leave it.
So?
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Maybe they lied to you.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
We?
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Thought it was my week for that.
I'll be late.
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Don't get kinky here...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
You know what I mean...
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Do you think we did the right thing?
You did!
Please.
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Gross. What is it?
You sure you didn't see one of these?
That's it?
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
You the bug lady, right?
Hello.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
What?
My God.
And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
This wing configuration. I've never...
No shit.
It bit you.
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
What is it?
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
What's this?
Oh, Jesus.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
She used a baster.
What?
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
