I don't.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
I know damn well she's there.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
You people really don't like dogs.
Don't feed that dog.
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
Yeah?
Hey, kid.
How the hell should I know?
Died there?  How?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Is it true?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Then what do you care?
Hell no!
He yours, sir?
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Go for it.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
You think that's really him?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
What the hell you talking about?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Just some flies.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
'S up?
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Keep smokin', fool.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Are you nuts?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
So what the hell's the good news?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Is this Hell?
Anywhere but here.
Climb out to where?
We can climb out.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Damned if I know.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Where's the others?
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Spooked?
Shit.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
You soundin' like the old man now.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
You want us to move in here?
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
That's some terrible shit.
That's what?
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Bones.
Wh-wh-whooo?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Looking to score?
Go on.  It won't kill you.
I said, no thanks.
Just try it.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
What else?  Money.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
You got a nice crib here.
What it will be.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Hush, baby.
But.
Where we'll always be...
Where are we, baby?
What?
I want you to do something for me, baby.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
Jimmy, you've got --
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Let me see your hand.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Then fuck it!!!
You know I can't.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
And the hell everybody else, right?
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
How did you get in here?
What it will be.
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
Sorry, my brother.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
We met.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Mother!  No.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
We'll have to sneak in.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Who?
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Your father.  He was your father.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
It's alright, baby.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Please.  It's for your own good.
All the more reason I should be here.
I lied.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
And what's that?
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Have you ever been inside?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
You mean as opposed to your life?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I have to finish this for class.
Aren't you going to join us?
I can't!
We gotta jump!
Here!
I can't find you.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Patrick, he's...
Bill!  Bill?!
I'm here.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I can't.  Not yet.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
Cinn?
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
And you believe her?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
The dead get out?
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Lucky thing.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
What else does she say?
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Why?
That place is already bad luck.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
I manage them.
How do you know?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Are they on the radio?
You moved into this block?
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Fuck it.  Alright.
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Where is it?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
You got the shit?
You got the cash?
Back here.  At the end of the block.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Daddy?
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
Dad?
Please...help me...
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
That's the past.  It's dead.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
You were just a kid.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
From what?
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Did you do it?
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
What are we doing down here?
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
No way man...
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Nice rack.  How old is --
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
I didn't sell it.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
What building?
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Don't call me that.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
What the hell do you want?
Now you.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
You was just doing your job.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Shit, that was fast.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
We just thought...
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
But --
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
It was just like in my head.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Post-toasted's more like it.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Potential toxic dump site.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
You gotta use your imagination.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Not that I remember.
You haven't?
Yeah, you heard of him?
Jimmy Bones?
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Should I?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
That building?
Not really to live, just to play.
No thanks.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
But the place burned to the ground.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
What we have to do is call the police.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
Evidence of what?
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Ours!
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Moe's terms.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
