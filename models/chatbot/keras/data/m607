I'm sure we will.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
What is this?  A whole new train?
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
In the next two minutes?
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Where have you been?
My God!  He's so excessive!
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
God in heaven, what is that?!
Thank you.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Of course not.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
It was in your book.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
There's only seventy-eight.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I know!  I know!
What?  President Grant is...!
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
My pleasure.
Oh, thank you.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
When we find him, he is mine.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
I adjusted it.
Not again.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
And people are actually fooled by that?
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
What is that?
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
Relax.  We're almost there.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
It's a town!
It's not a guy...
Willard...
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
What's this?
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
No record of him.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
It is?
It's better than nothing.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
This is good.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Know what this is?
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Thank you.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Can you fill me in here?
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
They're so precious when they're asleep.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
You might have mentioned you had that.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
So... what happened?
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Well... that, too.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
What way is that?
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Jim, are you all right?
That's right... That's good.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Hey, I tried the board.
At least I tried something.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
I'm going to hit you.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
All that jumping and kicking.
All what?
What was all that back there?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Now, what was that?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
You feeling all right?
Yes.  Now, observe....
Almost?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
That's a lot of butler.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
My disguise.  And here...
Prepare what?
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Limestone quarry?
What about the explosive?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Starting with a screw?
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Is this leading somewhere?
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Aha?
Aha!
I'll work on it.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Try what?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Always hoping.  Or this...
You need that real often?
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Wouldn't dream of it.
But don't pull that again.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Funny.  So am I.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Jim West.
J. S. Bach.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
He's not giving up?
But it only has six legs.
He calls it the Tarantula.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
Yes, me!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Anyone?
We'll see.
A new friend?
Fine, I'll stop.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
You bring the best out in a man.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
She's perfectly safe.
I've had some practice.
You've... done... this... before.
Oh, I would hope not.
Would that include me?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
You tell me.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
I don't like to lose, either.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You most certainly do.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Your guests, ma'am?
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
My... the wild west.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Really?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
My friend?
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Private train?
Your private train, sir.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Yes sir.
French?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
On my way to Denver...
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
And now the job's yours.
And?
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Nicely said, sir.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Good work.  Really.
That'll be all, boys.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Easy now.
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
The first.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
I've even printed my own currency.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
That would be... the Mexican War?
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Philistine.
He had a pressing engagement.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
You're not that big.
Dr. Loveless?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
I deal with some tough customers.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
I beg your pardon?
It is?
Now it's a bomb.
It's a smelting retort.
This is something.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
Are you all right?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Who was this partner of his?
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
We'll explain on the way.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Yes!
Dr. Pemberton?
Right.
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You're not going to use it, are you?
Hey...!
In an hour they're gone!
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
When are they coming?
They're coming.
Well?
