I can't believe it!
I love that.  That's my type.
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
Mmm?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Oh, listen...
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Come in, come in.
Oh, good...
Mm-mm!
...any sister talk?
Great.
And then, uh, April...huh?
Yeah.
Uh --
Uh, who gets dropped first?
A lot of works.
Yeah.
Look at this.
That's just --
Great.
Well, let's do it.
Oh, yeah.
You want to see some?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh--
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
Yeah.
Are you really interested?
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Oh.
Hi.
Well, let's hope so.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crÃªpes caviar.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
But I'm seeing him.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
And you, you-you're going?
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
No, he called late last night.
You're joking.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
What?
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Uh...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh...
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Well, I live downtown.
Okay.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Yeah.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
It's really terrible.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
That's disgusting!
It feels like you're in France.
Yeah.
It's French, though.  It really is.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
Right.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Oh, is that what it is?
Oh!
Oh, it's magnificent!
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
We're a big hit.
Mmm.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
I know.  It's terrible!
And maybe my lawyer.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Hmm?
Right.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Mm-hm.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Oh, okay.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Yes.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
We could...we could do that.
Well...
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Fast.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Yeah.
It does.
And it ruins everything else.
It's really sad.
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
Yeah.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Yes.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
Uh-huh.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
It's terrific!
Yeah.
What time do you get off?
Yeah.
I'm an architect.
Oh, what, what do you do?
I cry at the opera.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
You're Holly.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Oh no.  Not at all.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Is this your first job?
We're actresses.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
I can't resist.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
Like what?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
And it's just in one ear?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
When did you first notice this?
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Really?!
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
Let's take a look.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Mm-hm.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
This time I really think I have something.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
How ya doin', man?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Well, are...are they big?
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Uh-huh.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Yeah?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Dusty.
...cannot go on the air.
We--
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
Yes, but you name names.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
...with the affiliates.
Could you--
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Ed Smythe, yes.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Lee...
I care a great deal about him, yes.
And you're in love overnight?
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
But it hasn't been forever. 
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Is something wrong?
No.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Oh, all the time.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Oh, my God.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I know it isn't.
This is not an easy situation.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I didn't sleep all night.
Lee... uh...
I almost didn't.
I thought you weren't coming.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
I can't say anything!
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Poor Hannah.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
But not over me?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Why?
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Not because of me, I hope.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
What do you expect me to say?
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Why, you know the situation.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Oh, don't say those words!
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
I was looking for you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Elliot!
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
What are you doing?!
Oh!
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
Elliot!  Don't!
Did you ever read this one--?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Oh, right.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
Yeah.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
He's got like six gold records.
Oh.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, that's nice.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
How's everything?
Bye.
Bye.
Page a hundred and twelve.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, thanks a lot.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Well, sure.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
How-how's Frederick?
I'm...all right.
Yeah.  How are you?
Everything's okay? 
Yes.
Yes?
Uh, yes!
No?
No!  No...
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
No, I don't have time.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Yeah, sure. 
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yeah, you would.
Yes?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Oh, God.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Where are you headed?
Yes, I do.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
How about you?
Ohhhh!
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
You're out looking here?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
What are you doing here?
Hi.
Oh, Elliot!
Oh, my goodness!
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Yeah.
I don't know exactly.
Like, uh...?
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Oh, great.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
You're not lost.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
You matter to me.  Completely.
Leave me alone, can you?!
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
No.
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Are you?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
Are you in love with someone else?
I didn't say that.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
No!
Are you angry with me?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
I want one with you.
But, you got four children!
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
I don't know.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Why not?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Was I?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Are you in a bad mood?
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
It's so late.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Where're you going?
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
You bet.
Mmm.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
That's where your talent lies.
I know.
Great idea.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
She has all the cooking talent.
I know!  I know!
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Aren't they great?
They're fantastic.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Mm-hm?
Oh, honey!
Oh, Mom!
It's on the table, Dad.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Always.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
I am glad to see you.
Hi.  How's she doing?
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Yeah.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
I am... I did slave all day.
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
Get his wine away.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Mom, come out!
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
How do you know?
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
So?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Why should I be afraid?
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
How can we be happy?
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Oh...
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Who is it?
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
Yeah.
So you met somebody else?
I'm saying it now!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Stop accusing me!
You've been with someone!
No.
Oh, yes, you have!
No.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
What are you going to use for money?!
Because I have to!
Why?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Like what?
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
I can't take this anymore.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
What's the problem?
Oh, Frederick!
I don't sell my work by the yard!
They're in the basement.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
...or films you must see or... 
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Elliot lusts after you.
Yeah.
Me?
Because he likes you.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
Mm-hm.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Hmm?
Mmm...
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
Absolutely.
Are you sure?
No, nothing.
How about something to eat?
No, thank you.
Want some coffee or tea?
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Yes!
I know, I know, and your hamster.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
No.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Yes, please.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Yeah.  What?
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
You're just realizing this now?
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
It was on your shirt!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
But you don't have any symptoms!
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Like what?!  What?
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
But not you.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Like-- 
Hello?
N-n-no, not that.
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Oh, Jesus!
Yeah?
Look at this guy.
No--
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
You know... 
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
I think we need to eat.
Yeah?
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Oh, now-- 
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Like what?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Oh...
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Really?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Y-yeah.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
I'm okay.
How are you?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
No.
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
So how are you?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Why?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Oh, yeah?
I bumped into your...
Doesn't she look pretty?
Come on.
You look so beautiful.
Oh, great.
Okay.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
You've outdone yourself.
I think they're fantastic.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
I want to experience childbirth.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
What, by a st-stranger?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
What are you talking about?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
Well, then a third opinion.
This is the second opinion.
Is there no chance?
Gee.
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Wow!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Football!
Go right over there.
Oh!
Isn't that great?
That's a beauty!
Mh-hm.
Thanks, thanks.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
...you know?  I, uh...
That's really nice!
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
I know, I know.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Ohh!
The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
Yeah.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
I think so.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Oh!
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Yeah?
He's fine.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
How is everything?
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Huh?
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Very good.
I got two minutes.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I know...I know.
Hi!  Hi!
I'd have been a great dope addict.
True.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Now, Holly's not shy.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Okay, okay.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
You promised to stay on the wagon.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
...from Mavis, also.
Hey!
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
Well--
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Oh, so loosely.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
My script?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Hey, what's the matter?
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Good.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
What's the matter?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
You're too demanding.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Hmm!
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
How?
You treat me like a loser.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
Yeah, that's clerical.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Well-well, like what?
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Oh, God...
You got it.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, what do they know?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Boy--
So what's new?
Awwww...
Well, I just came from an audition...
Hey, hi!
Look, everything's going your way.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
I hope.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Yeah.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Easily.
Uh-huh.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
I know, no--  I know.
You know.
Ohh!
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Really?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Singing?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
You found all this, all this out on one date?
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
Oh?
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Oooo.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
He's married...
Oh, yeah. 
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Well, how about this?
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Oh!
Ouch!
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
He's such a loser!
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh, Hannah!
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Frederick didn't come with her.
I should get a garter belt.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
She really does, though.
Don't you think she does?
Yeah.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Uh-oh.
Ohh?
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Okay.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Yeah.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Uh-huh.
Two thousand dollars.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Oh, sure.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Perfect!
No, no, we decided!
What?  You're kidding!
I'm pregnant.
Mmm, what?
Mickey?
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Tch.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Thanks.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Just a few minutes ago.
When'd you get here?
Okay.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Hi.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Yeah.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
It's all right.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Oh, who cares?
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Oh, wow!
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, God!
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
Oh!
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Right.
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Really?
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Oh, well.
Well, what about me?
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Really?
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Yeah.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Hmm.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
You're okay, though, huh?
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
Oh.  Oh.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
You're kidding me.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
You have.
No, I haven't.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
No, the reason I ask is--
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Really?
Nobody ever said it.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
No, I am.  I am.
Come on.
No, you can tell me.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Yeah.
Have you?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Probably not.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Well...
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
I'm okay.
So how are you?
...namely a personality.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Well, I hope you've changed.
People change...you know.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
...in a really horrible way.
I'd never do that.
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 
Yeah, it was.
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Oh, no.
You look wonderful.
I'm fine.
Good.  How are you?
How are you?
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
We didn't hit it off.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Yeah.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
I recall you.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I remember you.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
God!
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yeah.  Me, too.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
I was so bored!
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
Thanks for a swell time.
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
My--uh...
No!
Can we, can we go?
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
You want some?
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Oh, why are you making those faces?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Why are you so upset?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Hmm.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
April?
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
...which I did not get.
Hi.
Dad!
Oh...
Dad...
Where are the antihistamines?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Yeah.
God.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Mm-hm.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
...read it over, and think about it.
Uh-huh.
Take our literature...
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
