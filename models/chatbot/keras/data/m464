Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Your grandmother?
Of course not.
Your mother.
No, she wasn't my sister.
She was your sister.
Si.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
He is your husband, no?
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
So.  How do we get to Rome?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
Because.
Why?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
Excuse me?
Buona notte.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
Were they pen pals?
Seriously.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
No, really.  What's she doing?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
What for?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
What's she doing?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
So, what's the story with your friend?
What is it?
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
What?
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
Yes.  We did.
We found each other, didn't we?
You're sure...
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Let's find a telephone.
Good.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
You're sure...
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
What?...
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Your hair... is perfect.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Yes.
--separate, in the evening..."
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
What great aunt?
Your great aunt.
Who's dying?
Exactly.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Dwayne?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Except possibly that.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
No...
I'm a liberal!
No.
Oh no.  Do you?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
What's mezzaluna?
...has a prior commitment.
Ha un numero di telefono?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
No.
Sa dov'e' lui?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
A very large pig.
What?...
But Faith--
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
But, Faith--
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
No.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Okaaaaayyyy.
We'll KNOW.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
Hm.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Non.  Please.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Amazing.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Thanks.
Congratulations.
My picture's up?
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
Hi there...
You...
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Where are you going?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Damon Bradley...
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
My name's 
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Who's this?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
I brought you that, too.
I was hoping for the real thing.
There is no us.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Yes.
Really?...
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Very funny.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
What would you call it?
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
I can't believe you did that!
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
What?
There's no such thing.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
GET OUT!!
Is something the matter?
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
In that case... no...
Yes.  I am.
Are you asking me out?
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Well.  Congratulations.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
You aren't?
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
I know the feeling.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Hi.
No.  Course not.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
I'm sorry.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
Yeah.
You okay?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
How about music?  You like classical?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
So were you.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Why are you doing this?
I don't know if that's such a--
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
You were saying...
We were hungry.
What are you doing here?
What?...
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
Nice dress.
What?
Hey--
You too.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
Well, good.  Good for you.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Yeah.
Oh.  That's nice.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
So.  You found him.
Hi.
Hi, Peter.
NO.
Do you want me to do it?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Right now?
He's out by the pool right now.
Or Hustler.
Mickey Spillane?
Mickey Spillane.
Please.  I need to know.
I'd really rather not say.
Tell me.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Why?
Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Where's Positano?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Because.  I know where he is.
Why not?
Who says I don't love him?...
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
So it wasn't real.
So?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
What?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Why are you asking me this?
You didn't answer my question.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Does he love you?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
He's safe.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
Yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Why can't you just tell me?
You are leaving, aren't you?
NO.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
You're limping.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
I'm in love with you.
How could you do this to me?
That was before I found out what it was.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
That's not the point.
Let's face it.  You want me.
What?
So, what are we waiting for?
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
Mommy, this is Faith.
Oh, hello.
Faith, this is my mother.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
So what do you think?
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
What looks good?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Excuse me?
And more...
Well, to-- new friends.
Really...
Really?
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Sure.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Yes?
Wait.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
I'll look forward to it.
You would?  Really?
Sure.
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Well, not exactly...
Any night.
Tonight?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Just since yesterday.
Been here long?
Sure is.
Beautiful place...
Hello.
Uh huh.
You're Damon Bradley?
Larry, did you rent a car?
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
What about Larry?
And Larry?...
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
Oh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Uh huh.
Kate is that you?
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
So...
When you could've found one in America.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Yup.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yes.  He is.
He's a jerk.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Maybe I can change him.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
And he is living proof.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
My God... you're right.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
What if he doesn't like me?
Whatareyoudoing?!
Is Damon Bradley here?
Joan Collins stayed here.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Amazing...
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Peter found him?
I'll be back before you leave.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
You sure you'll be okay?
No.  No, you go ahead.
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
What?
Who said I was going?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
What about Peter?...
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
...and a fortune teller.
It was a ouija board, remember?
I know, but...
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
A little bad luck?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
Why?
Packing.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Hi.  Where've you been?
Hi-iii...
Men have ways.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Like a detective.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
I meant about my idea.
That was really sweet...
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
And then what, Faith?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Good luck.
What?
Faith--
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Nope.
Is he looking at us?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Oh my God.  Where?
He's heeeeeerrre...
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Sure you did.
I never even got to be single.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
What's she saying?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
What did you say to her?
Right.  My brother.
Her brother.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Polo.
Larry bought himself cologne?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
That was a long time ago.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
'Course he does.
You think he misses me at all?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Sorry.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You expecting somebody you know?
Nothing.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
I'm hungry.
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Your brother?
Only, it's in Italian...
Only what?
A phone message.  Only--
What is it?
We're saved!
Oh.  Right.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
What'd you find?
Ah ha!...
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
So?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
I just got a dial tone--
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
He fell out.
What are you doing?
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
We lost him?...
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Are you sure?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
What?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Now what do we do?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
You okay?
You're coming with me?
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
Maybe.
Live happily ever after.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Thank you so much.
My God, you have...
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Because you were afraid to fly.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
You don't have a passport.
I have vacation time coming to me.
What about your job?
It's still the new year...
But it's July.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
It's a coincidence.
It's a miracle.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
No...  I can just tell.
Have you seen him with someone?
I think he's having an affair.
Is that bad?...
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Kate, is something the matter?
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
I know.  You're right.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
But what?
I know...  It was.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Yes you did.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Why don't you ask him?
No.  He's never asked me.
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
He's a podiatrist or something.
You don't have any idea?
I don't know, Kate.
What's he do?
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
So?...
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Is he gay?
No.
Is he married?
No.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
So, what's your point?
But somebody wrote those songs.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Is everything okay?
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Oh.
Scientologist.
How about that guy at the bank?
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about the other one?  His friend.
No.  He smokes.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
I don't believe in statistics.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
That's exactly what you are.
Huh?
Giovanni.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
But I do want to.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
I thank you.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
How old are you?
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
Oh.
It's siesta.
I'd love to.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
A porco?
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Kate.
And you are?...
She didn't give me a chance.
And you didn't tell her?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She what?!
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
Yeah--
He missed me.
I came after the woman I love.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
Went to high school with him. But...
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
What?  You know him?
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
You said it differently then.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
No.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Right.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
No, why?
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
You miss me?...
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Sorry...
Thanks.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Ten billion to one.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
That's really romantic.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
Mania.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
Good strategy.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Where is she?
She's not here.
I have to talk to her.
