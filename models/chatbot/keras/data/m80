Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Carter.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
Yes.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Care to join me?
That's it?
Charming.
I can be real stiff.
Only the real stiffs.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
The cemetery...
Where?
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Carter.
Girl scouts.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
No blood on the knife.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
That don't match either of the victim's.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
I like a woman who takes control.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Well, when you put it that way.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Why am I here?
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Funny, we just drove right in.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Carter.
Detective...
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Mind if we sit down?
Do I know you?
I'll be damned.
Doesn't look good.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Do you know who did this?
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
My god...
It's Amy Kramer.
A dead body?
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Another historical inaccuracy.
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
My office?
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
Nothing's missing?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
You sure?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
And miss the big game?  No way.
No.  Wait for the police.
Checking out your place.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
No shit.
No shit?!
I think someone broke into my house.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
That would work.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Please, get on the bus...
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
John...
What?  Where is she?
John, you can't help her now.
I'm not leaving without her.
Just get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Get on the bus.
He found you, didn't he?
I don't know.
Where are you going?
I was trying to protect you from this...
Why didn't you tell me?
No.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Yes.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Now you're joking, right?
I was trying to get away from someone.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Will, sit down...
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Just forget it...
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
It's an option.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Nothing.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
I know.
You're twisted.
I thought you'd never ask.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Where are you going?
My life is a living hell.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Forget it.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
No.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
What the --
You're so predictable.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Yeah.
Better?
Here, take my jacket.
I'm okay.
You look kind of cold.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Then I'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Can I come in?
I can see that.  Why?
I came to see you.
What are you doing here?!
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
I can't afford to get caught.
Why not?
Not me.
I borrowed it.
You stole it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Where'd you get it?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Michael Meyers!
Who?!
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Okay... thank you.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Keri, you all right?
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
Yeah.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Never.
Are you going to leave, too?
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Shit happens.
I can't believe this is happening.
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
He's my brother.
The serial killer?
Michael Meyers.
Who?
You're right.  It does sound strange.
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
What?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What are you looking at?
What?
Hey, you alright?
Bye Will.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Doesn't make it bad advice.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
It's not going to happen.
This kid just wants his freedom.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
Still wants to move out?
It's always John.
It's John, isn't it?
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Looks great.  It does.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Can't you?
Can't you hold it?
I have to pee.
What is it?
Wait.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Look, they're staring right at us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Let the party begin.
Very insightful.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Where's Shane?
Thanks!
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
You're so easy...
Shit, Linda!
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Shane's going as a condom.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Ooooh, busted.
You're unbelievable.
Better her than me.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
What's this?
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Fuckin' A.
I did alright.
You aced it, didn't you?
