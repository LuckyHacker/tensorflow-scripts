I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
What?
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
How are you going to find him?
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
'Mornin', Jack.
Bill, we need to talk!
Shit.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
And this is mine.
It's my nature.
You took Bill.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
Okay.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Aspirin.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Yeah. Good.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
No, Starla! No!
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
What?
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
What are you doing?!
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
I'm sorry.
That wasn't a good night, no.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
No reception out here.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Starla, it ain't --
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
How about Brenda?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
No. WhatÂ…?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Hey, Grant.
Grant, where'd you go?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Oh, yeah?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Pretty, ain't they?
Just checking out the lights.
What you up to?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Whatcha' doin'?
Sorry.
That's not funny.
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Shelby!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
He's a fucking Martian?!
We're coming your way, man!
Where are you?!
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
What's she see in that douchebag?
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Looks like a chipmunk.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Rorschach.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
What?
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Don't worry, Chief.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Hey there, Chief.
Do it.
I got to leave my post.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Sorry.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Yeah.
Are you nodding?
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shelby --
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Brought you munchies.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
What?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Shut up.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Who's the lucky fella?
Hell, I was game!
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
All the rib eyes?
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
How many you need?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
What can I do you for?
Sure thing, killer.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Meat.
Grant, you're sick!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, no!
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
I'll get if for you.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Who's that?
You're pretty.
What are you doing?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Okay.
You're my princess, aren't you?
My present?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Welcome home.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
I never danced in a towel before.
Out.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Where are you going?
That's disrespectful.
Flip.
Sure you do.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
It's just a work thing.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
When one sees you they all see you.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
What other stuff?
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Margaret.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Praise Jesus.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Where'd he go?
Hey, look!
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Gold--digger, huh?
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
