I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Who ever made that.
And you're gonna tell me who.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
They make you fart.
No onions?
No onions though, okay?
I'm buying.
You buying?
Care for a hot dog?
Talent. Hi.
Thanks, babe.
Don't thank me.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Could be.
I knew that.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Annie, I need a file.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
Don't interfere.
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
You're welcome.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
No.  I have one more thing to do.
How 'bout the morgue?
They couldn't do anything for me.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
It's only a flesh wound.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
I should be trying to stop you.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
I'm sorry as hell, man.
My name.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
I saw it, too.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
Fucking A, my friend.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You don't say.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
No further.  I'm serious.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
It can't rain all the time.
At least it finally stopped raining.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
I lost my key.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Mom --?
Not me.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun -- look at that guy...
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
In a better place.  I hope.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
I think he's yours, now.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Elly...
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
A remembrance.  A closure.
What's going on...?
I have to go.
You gotta go now, I bet.
No.
Do you feel okay.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
Does she have a name?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Mister Funboy.
Who?
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
I dabble.  May I?
You look like a rock star without a job.
Oh.
Mom tried to cook.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
She's still dead.
Well, how's your friend?
I went to see a friend of mine.
What's goin' on, Elly?
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Right.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I don't know you.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
I don't know you...
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Murderer.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
You don't even remember...
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
That's ancient history.
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Take the dope, too.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
T-Bird?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Another jolly nickname?
Top Dollar.
Wrong answer.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I can see her.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Your pain ends now.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Does it hurt?
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Neither.
Magic.
How the hell did you do that?
Very well, it's your ass.
Don't waste my time.
I'm already alone.
You'll be alone.
Fine with me.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Shut up.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Go away.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Leave me alone -- !
Get it?
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
Yes.
Miss her?
Shelly?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Interested?  Follow the crow.
What the hell are you?
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Leather purse...
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
...necklace... pearls...
18k.  Crap.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Move in, guys.
No shooting.
I've got him if you want him.
Is he inside?
We've got company.
Kill a dead guy?
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
That thing is poisonous.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
What... the hell is that?
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
The night is young.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
"Our" Crow...?
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Who got himself what?
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
An unexpected pleasure.
